 *
 * Change log:
 * 2009-02-02  JPP  - Fixed bug with AlwaysGroupByColumn where column header clicks would not resort groups.
 * 2009-02-01  JPP  - OLVColumn.CheckBoxes and TriStateCheckBoxes now work.
 * 2009-01-28  JPP  - Complete overhaul of renderers!
 *                       - Use IRenderer
 *                       - Added ObjectListView.ItemRenderer to draw whole items
 * 2009-01-23  JPP  - Simple Checkboxes now work properly
 *                  - Added TriStateCheckBoxes property to control whether the user can
 *                    set the row checkbox to have the Indeterminate value
 *                  - CheckState property is now just a wrapper around the StateImageIndex property
 * 2009-01-20  JPP  - Changed to always draw columns when owner drawn, rather than falling back on DrawDefault. 
 *                    This simplified several owner drawn problems
 *                  - Added DefaultRenderer property to help with the above
 *                  - HotItem background color is applied to all cells even when FullRowSelect is false
 *                  - Allow grouping by CheckedAspectName columns
 *                  - Commented out experimental animations. Still needs work.
 * 2009-01-17  JPP  - Added HotItemStyle and UseHotItem to highlight the row under the cursor
 *                  - Added UseCustomSelectionColors property
 *                  - Owner draw mode now honors ForeColor and BackColor settings on the list
 * 2009-01-16  JPP  - Changed to use EditorRegistry rather than hard coding cell editors
 * 2009-01-10  JPP  - Changed to use Equals() method rather than == to compare model objects.
 * v2.0.1
 * 2009-01-08  JPP  - Fixed long-standing "multiple columns generated" problem.
 *                    Thanks to pinkjones for his help with solving this one!
 *                  - Added EnsureGroupVisible()
 * 2009-01-07  JPP  - Made all public and protected methods virtual 
 *                  - FinishCellEditing, PossibleFinishCellEditing and CancelCellEditing are now public
 * 2008-12-20  JPP  - Fixed bug with group comparisons when a group key was null (SF#2445761)
 * 2008-12-19  JPP  - Fixed bug with space filling columns and layout events
 *                  - Fixed RowHeight so that it only changes the row height, not the width of the images.
 * v2.0
 * 2008-12-10  JPP  - Handle Backspace key. Resets the seach-by-typing state without delay
 *                  - Made some changes to the column collection editor to try and avoid
 *                    the multiple column generation problem.
 *                  - Updated some documentation
 * 2008-12-07  JPP  - Search-by-typing now works when showing groups
 *                  - Added BeforeSearching and AfterSearching events which are triggered when the user types
 *                    into the list.
 *                  - Added secondary sort information to Before/AfterSorting events
 *                  - Reorganized group sorting code. Now triggers Sorting events.
 *                  - Added GetItemIndexInDisplayOrder()
 *                  - Tweaked in the interaction of the column editor with the IDE so that we (normally)
 *                    don't rely on a hack to find the owning ObjectListView
 *                  - Changed all 'DefaultValue(typeof(Color), "Empty")' to 'DefaultValue(typeof(Color), "")'
 *                    since the first does not given Color.Empty as I thought, but the second does.
 * 2008-11-28  JPP  - Fixed long standing bug with horizontal scrollbar when shrinking the window.
 *                    (thanks to Bartosz Borowik)
 * 2008-11-25  JPP  - Added support for dynamic tooltips
 *                  - Split out comparers and header controls stuff into their own files
 * 2008-11-21  JPP  - Fixed bug where enabling grouping when there was not a sort column would not
 *                    produce a grouped list. Grouping column now defaults to column 0.
 *                  - Preserve selection on virtual lists when sorting
 * 2008-11-20  JPP  - Added ability to search by sort column to ObjectListView. Unified this with
 *                    ability that was already in VirtualObjectListView
 * 2008-11-19  JPP  - Fixed bug in ChangeToFilteredColumns() where DisplayOrder was not always restored correctly.
 * 2008-10-29  JPP  - Event argument blocks moved to directly within the namespace, rather than being
 *                    nested inside ObjectListView class.
 *                  - Removed OLVColumn.CellEditor since it was never used.
 *                  - Marked OLVColumn.AspectGetterAutoGenerated as obsolete (it has not been used for
 *                    several versions now).
 * 2008-10-28  JPP  - SelectedObjects is now an IList, rather than an ArrayList. This allows
 *                    it to accept generic list (eg List<File>).
 * 2008-10-09  JPP  - Support indeterminate checkbox values.
 *                    [BREAKING CHANGE] CheckStateGetter/CheckStatePutter now use CheckState types only.
 *                    BooleanCheckStateGetter and BooleanCheckStatePutter added to ease transition.
 * 2008-10-08  JPP  - Added setFocus parameter to SelectObject(), which allows focus to be set
 *                    at the same time as selecting.
 * 2008-09-27  JPP  - BIG CHANGE: Fissioned this file into separate files for each component
 * 2008-09-24  JPP  - Corrected bug with owner drawn lists where a column 0 with a renderer
 *                    would draw at column 0 even if column 0 was dragged to another position.
 *                  - Correctly handle space filling columns when columns are added/removed
 * 2008-09-16  JPP  - Consistently use try..finally for BeginUpdate()/EndUpdate() pairs
 * 2008-08-24  JPP  - If LastSortOrder is None when adding objects, don't force a resort.
 * 2008-08-22  JPP  - Catch and ignore some problems with setting TopIndex on FastObjectListViews.
 * 2008-08-05  JPP  - In the right-click column select menu, columns are now sorted by display order, rather than alphabetically
 * v1.13
 * 2008-07-23  JPP  - Consistently use copy-on-write semantics with Add/RemoveObject methods
 * 2008-07-10  JPP  - Enable validation on cell editors through a CellEditValidating event.
 *                    (thanks to Artiom Chilaru for the initial suggestion and implementation).
 * 2008-07-09  JPP  - Added HeaderControl.Handle to allow OLV to be used within UserControls.
 *                    (thanks to Michael Coffey for tracking this down).
 * 2008-06-23  JPP  - Split the more generally useful CopyObjectsToClipboard() method
 *                    out of CopySelectionToClipboard()
 * 2008-06-22  JPP  - Added AlwaysGroupByColumn and AlwaysGroupBySortOrder, which
 *                    force the list view to always be grouped by a particular column.
 * 2008-05-31  JPP  - Allow check boxes on FastObjectListViews
 *                  - Added CheckedObject and CheckedObjects properties
 * 2008-05-11  JPP  - Allow selection foreground and background colors to be changed.
 *                    Windows doesn't allow this, so we can only make it happen when owner
 *                    drawing. Set the HighlightForegroundColor and  HighlightBackgroundColor
 *                    properties and then call EnableCustomSelectionColors().
 * v1.12
 * 2008-05-08  JPP  - Fixed bug where the column select menu would not appear if the
 *                    ObjectListView has a context menu installed.
 * 2008-05-05  JPP  - Non detail views can now be owner drawn. The renderer installed for
 *                    primary column is given the chance to render the whole item.
 *                    See BusinessCardRenderer in the demo for an example.
 *                  - BREAKING CHANGE: RenderDelegate now returns a bool to indicate if default
 *                    rendering should be done. Previously returned void. Only important if your
 *                    code used RendererDelegate directly. Renderers derived from BaseRenderer
 *                    are unchanged.
 * 2008-05-03  JPP  - Changed cell editing to use values directly when the values are Strings.
 *                    Previously, values were always handed to the AspectToStringConverter.
 *                  - When editing a cell, tabbing no longer tries to edit the next subitem
 *                    when not in details view!
 * 2008-05-02  JPP  - MappedImageRenderer can now handle a Aspects that return a collection
 *                    of values. Each value will be drawn as its own image.
 *                  - Made AddObjects() and RemoveObjects() work for all flavours (or at least not crash)
 *                  - Fixed bug with clearing virtual lists that has been scrolled vertically
 *                  - Made TopItemIndex work with virtual lists.
 * 2008-05-01  JPP  - Added AddObjects() and RemoveObjects() to allow faster mods to the list
 *                  - Reorganised public properties. Now alphabetical.
 *                  - Made the class ObjectListViewState internal, as it always should have been.
 * v1.11
 * 2008-04-29  JPP  - Preserve scroll position when building the list or changing columns.
 *                  - Added TopItemIndex property. Due to problems with the underlying control, this
 *                    property is not always reliable. See property docs for info.
 * 2008-04-27  JPP  - Added SelectedIndex property.
 *                  - Use a different, more general strategy to handle Invoke(). Removed all delegates
 *                    that were only declared to support Invoke().
 *                  - Check all native structures for 64-bit correctness.
 * 2008-04-25  JPP  - Released on SourceForge.
 * 2008-04-13  JPP  - Added ColumnRightClick event.
 *                  - Made the assembly CLS-compliant. To do this, our cell editors were made internal, and
 *                    the constraint on FlagRenderer template parameter was removed (the type must still
 *                    be an IConvertible, but if it isn't, the error will be caught at runtime, not compile time).
 * 2008-04-12  JPP  - Changed HandleHeaderRightClick() to have a columnIndex parameter, which tells
 *                    exactly which column was right-clicked.
 * 2008-03-31  JPP  - Added SaveState() and RestoreState()
 *                  - When cell editing, scrolling with a mouse wheel now ends the edit operation.
 * v1.10
 * 2008-03-25  JPP  - Added space filling columns. See OLVColumn.FreeSpaceProportion property for details.
 *                    A space filling columns fills all (or a portion) of the width unoccupied by other columns.
 * 2008-03-23  JPP  - Finished tinkering with support for Mono. Compile with conditional compilation symbol 'MONO'
 *                    to enable. On Windows, current problems with Mono:
 *                    - grid lines on virtual lists crashes
 *                    - when grouped, items sometimes are not drawn when any item is scrolled out of view
 *                    - i can't seem to get owner drawing to work
 *                    - when editing cell values, the editing controls always appear behind the listview,
 *                      where they function fine -- the user just can't see them :-)
 * 2008-03-16  JPP  - Added some methods suggested by Chris Marlowe (thanks for the suggestions Chris)
 *                    - ClearObjects()
 *                    - GetCheckedObject(), GetCheckedObjects()
 *                    - GetItemAt() variation that gets both the item and the column under a point
 * 2008-02-28  JPP  - Fixed bug with subitem colors when using OwnerDrawn lists and a RowFormatter.
 * v1.9.1
 * 2008-01-29  JPP  - Fixed bug that caused owner-drawn virtual lists to use 100% CPU
 *                  - Added FlagRenderer to help draw bitwise-OR'ed flag values
 * 2008-01-23  JPP  - Fixed bug (introduced in v1.9) that made alternate row colour with groups not quite right
 *                  - Ensure that DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden is set on all non-browsable properties
 *                  - Make sure that sort indicators are shown after changing which columns are visible
 * 2008-01-21  JPP  - Added FastObjectListView
 * v1.9
 * 2008-01-18  JPP  - Added IncrementalUpdate()
 * 2008-01-16  JPP  - Right clicking on column header will allow the user to choose which columns are visible.
 *                    Set SelectColumnsOnRightClick to false to prevent this behaviour.
 *                  - Added ImagesRenderer to draw more than one images in a column
 *                  - Changed the positioning of the empty list m to use all the client area. Thanks to Matze.
 * 2007-12-13  JPP  - Added CopySelectionToClipboard(). Ctrl-C invokes this method. Supports text
 *                    and HTML formats.
 * 2007-12-12  JPP  - Added support for checkboxes via CheckStateGetter and CheckStatePutter properties.
 *                  - Made ObjectListView and OLVColumn into partial classes so that others can extend them.
 * 2007-12-09  JPP  - Added ability to have hidden columns, i.e. columns that the ObjectListView knows
 *                    about but that are not visible to the user. Controlled by OLVColumn.IsVisible.
 *                    Added ColumnSelectionForm to the project to show how it could be used in an application.
 *
 * v1.8
 * 2007-11-26  JPP  - Cell editing fully functional
 * 2007-11-21  JPP  - Added SelectionChanged event. This event is triggered once when the
 *                    selection changes, no matter how many items are selected or deselected (in
 *                    contrast to SelectedIndexChanged which is called once for every row that
 *                    is selected or deselected). Thanks to lupokehl42 (Daniel) for his suggestions and
 *                    improvements on this idea.
 * 2007-11-19  JPP  - First take at cell editing
 * 2007-11-17  JPP  - Changed so that items within a group are not sorted if lastSortOrder == None
 *                  - Only call MakeSortIndicatorImages() if we haven't already made the sort indicators
 *                    (Corrected misspelling in the name of the method too)
 * 2007-11-06  JPP  - Added ability to have secondary sort criteria when sorting
 *                    (SecondarySortColumn and SecondarySortOrder properties)
 *                  - Added SortGroupItemsByPrimaryColumn to allow group items to be sorted by the
 *                    primary column. Previous default was to sort by the grouping column.
 * v1.7
 * No big changes to this version but made to work with ListViewPrinter and released with it.
 *
 * 2007-11-05  JPP  - Changed BaseRenderer to use DrawString() rather than TextRenderer, since TextRenderer
 *                    does not work when printing.
 * v1.6
 * 2007-11-03  JPP  - Fixed some bugs in the rebuilding of DataListView.
 * 2007-10-31  JPP  - Changed to use builtin sort indicators on XP and later. This also avoids alignment
 *                    problems on Vista. (thanks to gravybod for the suggestion and example implementation)
 * 2007-10-21  JPP  - Added MinimumWidth and MaximumWidth properties to OLVColumn.
 *                  - Added ability for BuildList() to preserve selection. Calling BuildList() directly
 *                    tries to preserve selection; calling SetObjects() does not.
 *                  - Added SelectAll() and DeselectAll() methods. Useful for working with large lists.
 * 2007-10-08  JPP  - Added GetNextItem() and GetPreviousItem(), which walk sequentially through the
 *                    listview items, even when the view is grouped.
 *                  - Added SelectedItem property
 * 2007-09-28  JPP  - Optimized aspect-to-string conversion. BuildList() 15% faster.
 *                  - Added empty implementation of RefreshObjects() to VirtualObjectListView since
 *                    RefreshObjects() cannot work on virtual lists.
 * 2007-09-13  JPP  - Corrected bug with custom sorter in VirtualObjectListView (thanks for mpgjunky)
 * 2007-09-07  JPP  - Corrected image scaling bug in DrawAlignedImage() (thanks to krita970)
 * 2007-08-29  JPP  - Allow item count labels on groups to be set per column (thanks to cmarlow for idea)
 * 2007-08-14  JPP  - Major rework of DataListView based on Ian Griffiths's great work
 * 2007-08-11  JPP  - When empty, the control can now draw a "List Empty" m
 *                  - Added GetColumn() and GetItem() methods
 * v1.5
 * 2007-08-03  JPP  - Support animated GIFs in ImageRenderer
 *                  - Allow height of rows to be specified - EXPERIMENTAL!
 * 2007-07-26  JPP  - Optimised redrawing of owner-drawn lists by remembering the update rect
 *                  - Allow sort indicators to be turned off
 * 2007-06-30  JPP  - Added RowFormatter delegate
 *                  - Allow a different label when there is only one item in a group (thanks to cmarlow)
 * v1.4
 * 2007-04-12  JPP  - Allow owner drawn on steriods!
 *                  - Column headers now display sort indicators
 *                  - ImageGetter delegates can now return ints, strings or Images
 *                    (Images are only visible if the list is owner drawn)
 *                  - Added OLVColumn.MakeGroupies to help with group partitioning
 *                  - All normal listview views are now supported
 *                  - Allow dotted aspect names, e.g. Owner.Workgroup.Name (thanks to OlafD)
 *                  - Added SelectedObject and SelectedObjects properties
 * v1.3
 * 2007-03-01  JPP  - Added DataListView
 *                  - Added VirtualObjectListView
 * 					- Added Freeze/Unfreeze capabilities
 *                  - Allowed sort handler to be installed
 *                  - Simplified sort comparisons: handles 95% of cases with only 6 lines of code!
 *                  - Fixed bug with alternative line colors on unsorted lists (thanks to cmarlow)
 * 2007-01-13  JPP  - Fixed bug with lastSortOrder (thanks to Kwan Fu Sit)
 *                  - Non-OLVColumns are no longer allowed
 * 2007-01-04  JPP  - Clear sorter before rebuilding list. 10x faster! (thanks to aaberg)
 *                  - Include GetField in GetAspectByName() so field values can be Invoked too.
 * 					- Fixed subtle bug in RefreshItem() that erased background colors.
 * 2006-11-01  JPP  - Added alternate line colouring
 * 2006-10-20  JPP  - Refactored all sorting comparisons and made it extendable. See ComparerManager.
 *                  - Improved IDE integration
 *                  - Made control DoubleBuffered
 *                  - Added object selection methods
 * 2006-10-13  JPP  Implemented grouping and column sorting
 * 2006-10-09  JPP  Initial version
