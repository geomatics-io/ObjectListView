# ObjectListView

ObjectListView is a powerful .NET library for creating interactive, data-driven WinForms ListView controls. It provides advanced features and customization options that go beyond the capabilities of the standard ListView control.

## About

ObjectListView is a .NET ListView wired on caffeine, guarana and steroids. More calmly, it is a C# wrapper around a .NET ListView, which makes the ListView much easier to use and teaches it lots of neat new tricks.

## Usage

To use ObjectListView in your WinForms application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Add the ObjectListView project to your Visual Studio solution.
3. Reference the ObjectListView project in your WinForms project.
4. In your form designer, add an instance of the `ObjectListView` control to your form.
5. Bind the `ObjectListView` control to a data source by setting the `DataSource` property.
6. Customize the columns, formatting, sorting, grouping, and other features as needed using the provided properties and methods.

## Why I Forked It

I have forked the ObjectListView repository to address the fact that its latest Visual Studio version is 2012, while I'm currently using Visual Studio 2022. By forking the repository, I intend to upgrade it to support the latest version of Visual Studio and make any necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility with modern development environments.

Furthermore, forking the repository gives me the opportunity to contribute additional features and improvements to ObjectListView in the future. I'm excited to actively maintain and enhance this library to meet the evolving needs of WinForms developers.
