.. _recipe-flavour:

1. What flavour of ObjectListView do I want to use?
---------------------------------------------------

There are four basic flavours of ObjectListView. Of those, three have data bound versions.

ObjectListView - Plain Vanilla
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/icecream3.jpg
    :class: left-padded

*Stock standard, but still very nice*

A normal `ObjectListView` is capable of anything a `ListView` can do -- only in a much
easier to use package. Though it will handle a large number of rows, it is better
suited for smaller lists, that is, about 1000 rows or less.

If in doubt, start with this flavour. You can always change it to one of the others later on.


VirtualObjectListView - Espresso
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/coffee.jpg
    :class: left-padded

*Has a slight bitter taste, but makes you capable of anything*

When you want to knock your users out with 10 million search results, a
`VirtualObjectListView` is for you. It can handle any number of objects.

But it does so at a cost:

* You have to implement the `IVirtualListDataSource` interface.
* It cannot use *Tile* view.
* It cannot display animated GIFs
* It cannot show groups (but if you are running on Vista and don't mind
  doing some work, see :ref:`recipe-virtualgroups`)

But for the cost of this "bitterness," you really can do anything.

FastObjectListView - Red Bull
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/redbull.jpg
    :class: left-padded

*Also makes you capable of anything, but without the bitterness*

When you want speed, speed, and more speed, but you don't want the bitterness of
the `VirtualObjectListView`, a `FastObjectListView` is your weapon of choice. It
operates just like a normal `ObjectListView` -- only much faster.

It does have a couple of limitations:

* It also cannot use *Tile* view
* It cannot show animated GIFs
* It cannot show groups on XP

But apart from that it operates just like a normal `ObjectListView`.

Did I mention the speed?


TreeListView - Kaffa Lime Leaf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/limeleaf.jpg
    :class: left-padded

*Adds a distinctive flavour*

If you have a tree structured data model, and you want to show common
information about the branches and the leaves of the structure, a `TreeListView`
is at your disposal.

See :ref:`recipe-treelistview` for more information.

.. _label-datalistviewsummary:

DataListView - Strawberry Smoothie
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/smoothie2.jpg
    :class: left-padded

*Everything is just smooth and easy*

A `DataListView` is for the ultra-slothful: those who literally do not want to even write one line of code.

A `DataListView` can be given a `DataSource` from within the IDE, and it will
automatically keep itself sync with that `DataSource`. Further, if the
`DataListView` is marked as editable, edits will be automatically written into the
`DataSource`.

.. _label-fastdatalistviewsummary:

FastDataListView - Chilli Smoothie
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/chili-smoothie2.jpg
   :class: left-padded

*Fast and easy*

A `FastDataListView` combines speed with ease of use: the speed of a virtual list with the
ease of `DataListView`. On my mid-range laptop, a `FastDataListView` can easily handle data sets of 100,000 rows or more.

A `FastDataListView` virtualizes the *display* of the data set -- it does not change the process of
loading data into the dataset. If your dataset is a SQL statement that fetches one million rows
from a remote database, your program will still have to load all one millions rows. Once loaded, however,
`FastDataListView` will show them almost instantly.

DataTreeListView - Lime Smoothie
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/chili-smoothie2.jpg
   :class: left-padded

*Hierarchy -- fast and easy*

A `DataTreeListView` makes tree structured data available to the ultra-slothful. Simply
tell the `DataTreeListView` which column holds the row id, and which holds the parent id,
and the list will make a fully functional tree listview all by itself.

See :ref:`recipe-datatreelistview` for more information.

.. _recipe-editing:

2. How do I let the user edit the values shown in the list?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This really needs a page to itself: :ref:`Cell Editing in an ObjectListView <cell-editing-label>`

.. _recipe-sorting:

3. How can I do some fancy sorting?
-----------------------------------

There are a couple of ways to change the standard sorting behaviour:

* You can listen for the `BeforeSorting` event, do whatever sorting you like, and then set
  `Handled` to  *true* on the event so that no standard sorting is done. If you want
  to prevent sorting, you can set `Canceled` to  *true*.

* If you are using an `ObjectListView` or a `DataListView`, you can install a
  `CustomSorter` delegate.

* If you are using a `VirtualObjectListView` (or one of its subclasses
  `FastObjectListView` or `TreeListView`), you cannot use the `CustomSorter`. You have
  to implement the `SortObjects()` method of the `IVirtualListDataSource`.

The `CustomSorter` delegates needs a little further explanation. This delegate
must install a `ListViewItemSorter` on the `ObjectListView`. This installed item
sorter will actually do the work of sorting the `ListViewItems`. See
`ColumnComparer` in the code for an example of what an item sorter has to do.

NOTE: This delegate does not sort the model objects themselves. Remember this
control knows nothing about your model objects, so sorting them makes no
difference to the control. You have to install the `ListViewItemSorter`.

So if you were using a normal `ObjectListView` to show a collection of medical
incidents, and you wanted to sort them so that the emergencies were always shown
first, you could install a delegate like this::

    this.incidentListView.CustomSorter = delegate(OLVColumn column, SortOrder order) {
        this.incidentListView.ListViewItemSorter = new ColumnComparer(
                this.isEmergencyColumn, SortOrder.Descending, column, order);
    };

This says, sort the items by the value in the "Is Emergency?" column first, and
secondarily by the column that the user just clicked on. Remember that the
`OLVColumn` given to the `ColumnComparer` does not have to an active column in the
control. You can create one just for the custom sorter. So, even if there was no
"Is Emergency?" column, you could still sort by the incidents so that
emergencies were shown first::

    this.incidentListView.CustomSorter = delegate(OLVColumn column, SortOrder order) {
        this.incidentListView.ListViewItemSorter = new ColumnComparer(
                new OLVColumn("ignored", "IsEmergency"), SortOrder.Descending, column, order);
    };

And if you were using a `VirtualObjectListView` to show a collection of 10 million
mailing addresses, and you wanted to sort them in some fashion, you would
implement the `SortObjects()` method of the `IVirtualListDataSource` like this::

    class MyMailingAddressesDataSource : AbstractVirtualListDataSource
    {
        ...
        override public void SortObjects(OLVColumn column, SortOrder order) {
            SortMailingAddressBy(column.AspectName, order);
        };
    };

No CustomSorter on FastObjectListView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One incompatibility between v1.x and v2.0 is that `FastObjectListViews` can no
longer have a `CustomSorter`. In v1.x it was possible, if tricky, to get a
`CustomSorter` to work with a `FastObjectListView`, but that is no longer possible
in v2.0 In v2.0, if you want to custom sort a `FastObjectListView`, you will have
to subclass `FastObjectListDataSource` and override the `SortObjects()` method, then
install that customized data source into your `FastObjectListView`::

    class MyCustomSortingDataSource : FastVirtualListDataSource
    {
        override public void SortObjects(OLVColumn column, SortOrder order) {
            // do some amazing sorting here
            this.RebuildIndexMap(); // you must call this otherwise the control will not work properly
        };
    };
    ...
    this.myFastObjectListView.DataSource = new MyCustomSortingDataSource(this.myFastObjectListView);

.. _recipe-ownerdrawn:

4. How can I draw the values in the cell's myself?
--------------------------------------------------

This needs a page to itself as well: :ref:`How to owner draw my values <owner-draw-label>`?

.. _recipe-column-width:

5. How can I stop the user from making a column too narrow or too wide?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Columns have both `MinimumWidth` and `MaximumWidth` properties. By default, these are -1,
which means that no limit is enforced. But if they are set to some other value, the column
will be limited to the given minimum or maximum width.

For example, this::

    this.titleColumn.MinimumWidth = 30

will stop the "Title" column from becoming less than 30 pixels in width. This is useful
for preventing users from shrinking columns to 0 width and then not being about to find
them again.


.. _recipe-fixed-column:

6. How can I stop the user from resizing a column?
--------------------------------------------------

There are some columns just don't make sense to be resizeable. A column that
always shows a 16x16 status icon makes no sense to be resizeable. To make a
column be fixed width and unresizable by the user, simply set both `MinimumWidth`
and `MaximumWidth` to be the same value.

.. _recipe-column-filling:

7. How can I make a column get bigger when the ObjectListView is made bigger?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On most columns, the column's width is static, meaning that it doesn't change by
itself. But sometimes it would be useful if a column would resize itself to show
more (or less) of itself when the user changed the size of the ListView. For
example, the rightmost column of a personnel list might display "Comments" about
that person. When the window was made larger, it would be nice if that column
automatically expanded to show more of the comments about that person. You can
make this happen by setting the `FillsFreeSpace` property to  *true* on that column.

An `ObjectListView` can have more than one space filling column, and they
generally share the available space equally between them (see the
`FreeSpaceProportion` property to change this).

You should be aware that as the `ObjectListView` becomes smaller, the space
filling columns will become smaller too, until they eventually disappear (have
zero width). The `MinimumWidth` and `MaximumWidth` properties still work for space
filling columns. So you can use the `MinimumWidth` property to make sure that a
space filling column doesn't disappear.


.. _recipe-formatter:

8. How can I change the colours of a row or just a cell?
--------------------------------------------------------

You listen for `FormatRow` or `FormatCell` event. 

To show customers in red when they owe money,
you would set up a handler for the `FormatRow` event in the IDE, and then do
something like this::

    private void olv1_FormatRow(object sender, FormatRowEventArgs e) {
        Customer customer = (Customer)e.Model;
        if (customer.Credit < 0)
            e.Item.BackColor = Color.Red;
    }

To change the formatting of an individual cell, you need to set
`UseCellFormatEvents` to *true* and then listen for `FormatCell` events.
To show just the credit balance in red, you could do something like this::

    private void olv1_FormatCell(object sender, FormatCellEventArgs e) {
        if (e.ColumnIndex == this.creditBalanceColumn.Index) {
            Customer customer = (Customer)e.Model;
            if (customer.Credit < 0)
                e.SubItem.ForeColor = Color.Red;
        }
    }

These events play well
with `UseAlternatingBackColors`. Any formatting you do in these events takes
precedence over the alternate back colours.

These events know where the row is going to
appear in the control, so the `DisplayIndex` property of the event
can be used for more sophisticated alternate background colour schemes.
The `DisplayIndex` is correct even when the list is showing groups and
when the listview is virtual.

To improve performance, `FormatCell` events are only fired when a handler
of the `FormatRow`
event sets `UseCellFormatEvents` to *true*. If you want to have a `FormatCell`
event fired for every cell, you can set `UseCellFormatEvents` on the
`ObjectListView` itself.

Priority
^^^^^^^^

There are lots of bits that can influence the format of a row or cell,
and they can interact in complex fashions.

The various formatting options are applied in this order, with later formatting
overriding earlier formatting:

 1. Disabled
 2. AlternateBackColors (not applied if row is disabled)
 3. FormatRow
 4. FormatCell
 5. Hyperlinks
 6. Selection


.. _recipe-listviewprinter:

9. How can I make my ObjectListView into a shiny report?
--------------------------------------------------------

You make a `ListViewReporter` object in your IDE, and you set the `ListView`
property to be the `ObjectListView` you want to print.

There is a whole article available on CodeProject explaining in detail how to do
this: `Turning a ListView into a nice report`_. Read the article and play with demo
to see how it works. However don't use the code from that article -- it is defunct.
The `ListViewReporter` code in ObjectListView project is up-to-date.

.. _recipe-checkbox:

10. How do I use checkboxes in my ObjectListView?
-------------------------------------------------

To uses checkboxes with an ObjectListView, you must set the `ObjectListView.CheckBoxes`
property to  *true*. If you want the user to be able to give check boxes the
*Indeterminate* value, you should set the `ObjectListView.TriStateCheckBoxes` property to
*true*.

Owing to a limitation of the .NET ListView class, you cannot use `CheckBoxes` in `Tile` view.
It just can't be done.

.. _using-checkboxes-programmatically:

Using checkboxes programmatically
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `ObjectListView.CheckObjects` property allows you to get or set the collection of
model objects that are currently checked. You can also use `ObjectListView.CheckAll()`
and `ObjectListView.UncheckAll()` to (no surprise) check or uncheck all items.

To decide if a particular model is checked, use `IsChecked()` or
`IsCheckedIndeterminate()`.

To changed the "checked-ness" of a model, you should use:

* `CheckIndeterminateObject()`
* `CheckObject(object model)`
* `ToggleCheckObject()`
* `UncheckObject()`

For sub-item checkboxes, there are the same collection of methods, but they take
a `OLVColumn` parameter to indicate which subitem should be fetched or set.

* `CheckSubItem(object model, OLVColumn column)`
* `CheckIndeterminateSubItem(object model, OLVColumn column)`
* `IsSubItemChecked(object model, OLVColumn column)`
* `ToggleSubItem(object model, OLVColumn column)`
* `UncheckSubItem(object model, OLVColumn column)`

Data bound checkboxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Without doing anything else, 
the check boxes act as a more durable form of selection.

If you want the checkboxes to reflect some actual property in your model,
you can bind the checkbox to a property in two ways: 

1. Use `CheckedAspectName`

If your model object already has a property that directly matches
whether or not a row should be checked, a `CheckedAspectName` is the simplest
approach. Simply set the `CheckedAspectName` to the name of your property, and
the `ObjectListView` will handle everything else, both the getting and the
setting of this property's value. The property must be of type `bool` (or of type
`bool?` if you want to use tri-state).

2. Use `CheckStateGetter` and `CheckStatePutter`

If `CheckedAspectName` is too simple for your needs, you can install
`CheckStateGetter` and `CheckStatePutter` delegates. The first delegate is used to
decide if the checkbox on the row that is showing the given model object should
be checked or unchecked. The second is called when the user clicked the check
box.

There are two flavour of check state getter/putters: there are `CheckStateGetter`
and `CheckStatePutter` delegates which deal with `CheckStates`; and there are
`BooleanCheckStateGetter` and `BooleanCheckStatePutter` delegates which deal only
with `booleans`. If you are only interested in checkboxes being on or off, the
boolean versions are what you want. However, if you want to deal with
indeterminate values too, you must use the `CheckState` versions::

    this.objectListView1.BooleanCheckStateGetter = delegate(Object rowObject) {
        return ((Person)rowObject).IsActive;
    };

    this.objectListView1.BooleanCheckStatePutter = delegate(Object rowObject, bool newValue) {
        ((Person)rowObject).IsActive = newValue;
        return newValue; // return the value that you want the control to use
    };

Note that the `CheckStatePutter` returns the value that will actually be used.
This doesn't have to be the same as the value that was given. So your delegate
can refuse to accept the checking of a particular model if it wants.

Sub-item checkboxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`ObjectListViews` supports checkboxes on subitems.
To enable this, `ObjectListView.UseSubItemCheckBoxes` must be set to true.

Subitem checkboxes are always data-bound, i.e. they must be linked to a property on 
your model objects.

If `CheckBoxes` is True on a column, the aspect for that column will be
interpreted as a boolean value and a check box will be displayed to represent
that value. If the `ObjectListView` is owner drawn, the check box will be aligned
following the column `Alignment`, but in standard mode, the check box will always
be to the far left.

If `TriStateCheckBoxes` is True, the user will be able to set the check box to have
the `Indeterminate` value.

If you use tri state checkboxes on subitems, your model must be able to handle the third
state. This means your data must be either a `bool?` or a `CheckState`. If you have a simple
boolean field, setting `TriStateCheckBoxes` is pointless since your data cannot handle
the Indeterminate state (*null* in this case).

Setting either `CheckBoxes` or `TriStateCheckBoxes` on column 0 does nothing since
the check box on column 0 is the checkbox for the whole row. It is controlled by
settings on the `ObjectListView` itself.

Differences from .NET ListView CheckBoxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normal .Net `ListViews` support checkboxes -- but not on virtual lists.
If you try to use the standard `ListView.CheckIndicies` or `ListView.CheckedItems` properties on, say,
a `FastObjectListView` or a `TreeListView`, .NET will throw an exception.

`ObjectListView` supports checkboxes on both virtual and non-virtual lists,
but to do so, you *must* use the methods listed above -- trying to use the native
.NET mechanism will only give you grief.

`ObjectListView` will still trigger 
the normal `ItemCheck` and `ItemChecked` events know when a check box has changed value.

You can still read the `Checked` property of a `ListViewItem` to know if that item is checked 
-- but remember that `ListViewItems` are evil and indicate :ref:`a lapse into the Dark Side <listviewitems-are-evil>`.

To modify the `Checked` property programmatically, 
it's best to use the above listed operations to get and set whether or not an object
is checked. 

However, if you really *have to* programmatically set the `Checked` property on a list view item, 
you *must* do so through
the `OLVListItem.Checked` property, NOT through the base class property, `ListViewItem.Checked`.
If you programmatically set `ListViewItem.Checked`, `ObjectListView` will never know that you have
set that value, and strange things will happen (specifically, the checkbox on that row will
stop responding to clicks).

So, this code -- which tries to toggle the checkedness of the
selected rows -- will cause problems for your `ObjectListView`::

    private void objectListView1_ItemActivate(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        foreach (ListViewItem lvi in objectListView1.SelectedItems)
            lvi.Checked = !lvi.Checked;
    }

This will work -- once! After that, it will not work again. Worse, the check boxes will
stop responding to user clicks. To work
properly, you treat the items as `OLVListItem`::

    private void objectListView1_ItemActivate(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        foreach (OLVListItem olvi in objectListView1.SelectedItems)
            olvi.Checked = !olvi.Checked;
    }

This will work as expected. But much better would be to simply use `ToggleCheckObject()`.


CheckBoxes and virtual lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The standard .NET `ListView` cannot have `CheckBoxes` on virtual lists. However,
`VirtualObjectListView` (and thus `FastObjectListView` and `TreeListView`)
can support checkboxes. All flavours of `ObjectListView` support checkboxes equally.

The only caveat for using check boxes on virtual lists is that, when a
`CheckStateGetter` (or `BooleanCheckStateGetter`) is installed, the control has to iterate the entire list when
the `CheckedObjects` property is read. Without a `CheckStateGetter`, the control
assumes that nothing is checked until the user (or the programmer) explicitly
checks it. So it knows which objects have been checked and can simply return
them as the value of the `CheckedObjects` property. 

But when a `CheckStateGetter` is
installed, the only way the control can know whether an object is checked is by
calling the `CheckStateGetter` delegate for every object in the list. 
So to return the value of `CheckedObjects`
property, the control must iterate the whole list, asking in turn if this object
is checked. This is fine if the list has only 100 or even 1000 objects, but if
the list has 10,000,000 objects, your program is going to hang.

Virtual lists persist the "checkedness" of individual objects across calls to
`SetObjects()` (and other list modifying operations). To make the list forget
the "checkedness" of all objects, call `ClearObjects()`.

.. _recipe-tileview:

11. How do change the information that's displayed in Tile view?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The information that is shown when in Tile view is customisable. The primary
column has to appear, but the other "rows" are configurable. In the example
below, the Person's name appears, since that is the primary column, but the
"Occupation", "Birthdate", and "Hourly Rate" pieces of information are shown as
well.

.. image:: images/tileview-example.png

To do this, set `IsTileViewColumn` to  *true* for those columns that you want to
appear in the Tile view. Confusingly, a column in Detail view becomes a "row" in
a Tile view.

If you really want to change the information in the Tile view, you can custom
draw it! To do this, install an `ItemRenderer` on the list and
set `OwnerDraw` to  *true*. See `BusinessCardRenderer` in the demo project for an
example implementation. To see that renderer in action, run the demo, switch to
the "Complex" tab, click the "Owner Drawn" checkbox, and switch to Tile view.


.. _recipe-emptymsg:

12. How do I change the message that's shown when the ObjectListView is empty?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an `ObjectListView` is empty, it can display a "this list is empty" type message.

The `EmptyListMsg` is the property that holds the string that appears when an
`ObjectListView` is empty. This string is rendered using the `EmptyListMsgFont`::

    this.objectListView1.EmptyListMsg = "This database has no rows";
    this.objectListView1.EmptyListMsgFont = new Font("Tahoma", 24);

The empty message list is actually implemented as an overlay. You can access that overlay
though the `EmptyListMsgOverlay` property. By default, this is a `TextOverlay` that
you can customise to your hearts content::

    TextOverlay textOverlay = this.objectListView1.EmptyListMsgOverlay as TextOverlay;
    textOverlay.TextColor = Color.Firebrick;
    textOverlay.BackColor = Color.AntiqueWhite;
    textOverlay.BorderColor = Color.DarkRed;
    textOverlay.BorderWidth = 4.0f;
    textOverlay.Font = new Font("Chiller", 36);
    textOverlay.Rotation = -5;

gives this:

.. image:: images/emptylistmsg-example.png

If you really want to, you can set the `EmptyListMsgOverlay` property to an
object that implement the `IOverlay` interface, and then draw whatever you want
to.

.. _recipe-images-from-db:

13. On the rows of my ObjectListView, I want to show images that come from a database. How do I do that?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, images that are shown on rows come from an `ImageList`. The `ImageGetter`
delegate simply returns the index of the image that should be drawn against the
cell. However, sometimes, the images that should be drawn are not known at
compile time. Or they are generated dynamically from some characteristic of the
model object being displayed. In such cases, the `ImageList` cannot be pre-
populated with the images to be used. But with a little planning, you can still
use your `ImageList` to manage your images, even when the `Images` are dynamically
retrieved.

First, give your `ObjectListView` an empty `SmallImageList` and an empty `LargeImageList`.

Secondly, install an `ImageGetter` delegate on your primary column that does something like this::

    this.mainColumn.ImageGetter = delegate(object row) {
        String key = this.GetImageKey(row);
        if (!this.listView.LargeImageList.Images.ContainsKey(key)) {
            Image smallImage = this.GetSmallImageFromStorage(key);
            Image largeImage = this.GetLargeImageFromStorage(key);
            this.listView.SmallImageList.Images.Add(key, smallImage);
            this.listView.LargeImageList.Images.Add(key, largeImage);
        }
        return key;
    };

This dynamically fetches the images if they haven't been already fetched. You
will need to write the `GetImageKey()`, `GetSmallImageFromStorage()` and
`GetLargeImageFromStorage()` methods. Their names will probably be different,
depending on exactly how you are deciding which image is shown against which
model object.

For example, if we were writing a File Explorer look-a-like, we might have something that looks like this::

    this.mainColumn.ImageGetter = delegate(object row) {
        File theFile = (File)row;
        String extension = this.GetFileExtension(theFile);
        if (!this.listView.LargeImageList.Images.ContainsKey(extension)) {
            Image smallImage = this.GetSmallIconForFileType(extension);
            Image largeImage = this.GetLargeIconForFileType(extension);
            this.listView.SmallImageList.Images.Add(extension, smallImage);
            this.listView.LargeImageList.Images.Add(extension, largeImage);
        }
        return key;
    };

If you only use Details view, you don't need to maintain the `LargeImageList`, but
if you use any other view, you must keep the `SmallImageList` and the
`LargeImageList` in sync.


.. _recipe-typedobjectlistview:

14. Isn't there are way to get rid of all the casts in the delegates?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. You can use a `TypedObjectListView` wrapper.

One annoyance with `ObjectListView` is all the casting that is needed. Because the
`ObjectListView` makes no assumptions about what sort of model objects you will be
using, it handles all models as `objects` and it's up to you to cast them to the
right type when you need to. This leads to many delegates starting with a cast
like this::

    this.objectListView1.SomeDelegate = delegate(object x) {
        MyModelObject model = (MyModelObject)x;
        ...
    }

which becomes tiresome after a while. It would be nice if you could tell the
`ObjectListView` that it would always be displaying, say, Person objects.
Something like::

    this.objectListView1 = new ObjectListView<Person>();
    this.objectListView1.SomeDelegate = delegate(Person model) {
        ...
    }

Unfortunately, this is not possible, so we have a `TypedObjectListView` class
instead. This is not another `ObjectListView` subclass, but rather it's a typed
wrapper around an existing ObjectListView. To use one, you create an
`ObjectListView` within the IDE as normal. When it is time to implement your
delegates, you create a `TypedObjectListView` wrapper around your list view, and
declare your delegates against that wrapper. It's easier to use than it is to
explain, so look at this example::

    TypedObjectListView<Person> tlist = new TypedObjectListView<Person>(this.listViewSimple);
    tlist.BooleanCheckStateGetter = delegate(Person x) {
        return x.IsActive;
    };
    tlist.BooleanCheckStatePutter = delegate(Person x, bool newValue) {
        x.IsActive = newValue;
        return newValue;
    };

Look ma! No casts! The delegates are declared against the typed wrapper, which
does know what model objects are being used.

You can also use the `TypedObjectListView` for typed access to the delegates on your columns::

    tlist.GetColumn(0).AspectGetter = delegate(Person x) { return x.Name; };
    tlist.GetColumn(1).AspectGetter = delegate(Person x) { return x.Occupation; };

If you don't like referring to columns by their index, you can create
`TypedColumn` objects around a given `ColumnHeader` object::

    TypedColumn<Person> tcol = new TypedColumn<Person>(this.columnHeader16);
    tcol.AspectGetter = delegate(Person x) { return x.GetRate(); };
    tcol.AspectPutter = delegate(Person x, object newValue) { x.SetRate((double)newValue); };

Generating AspectGetters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A side benefit of a `TypedObjectListView` is that it can automatically generate an
`AspectGetter` for a column from its `AspectName`. So, rather than hand-coding
`AspectGetters` like we have done above, you simply configure the `AspectName` in
the IDE, and then call `tlist.GenerateAspectGetters()`. This can (should?) handle
aspects of arbitrary complexity, like "Parent.HomeAddress.Phone.AreaCode".

This allows the convenience of reflection, but the speed of hand-written `AspectGetters`.


.. _recipe-treelistview:

15. How do I use a TreeListView?
--------------------------------

A `TreeListView` shows a tree structure with its nice ability to expand and
collapse, but also shows information in columns.

A functioning `TreeListView` needs three things:

1. A list of top level objects (called `Roots`).

2. A way to know if a given model can be expanded.

3. A way to know which models should appear as the children of another model.

Like all the other `ObjectListViews`, `TreeListView` relies on delegates. The
two essential delegates for using a `TreeListView` are:

* `CanExpandGetter` is used to decide if a given model can be expanded

* `ChildrenGetter` is used to gather the children that will appear under a given
  model after it is expanded. This delegate is only called if `CanExpandGetter` has
  returned true for that model object.

In the demo, there is an Explorer like example, which navigates the disks on the
local computer. The tree list view in that demo is configured so that only
directories can be expanded. It looks like this::

    this.treeListView.CanExpandGetter = delegate(object x) {
        return (x is DirectoryInfo);
    };

The `ChildrenGetter` delegate gets the contents of a directory when that directory is
expanded::

    this.treeListView.ChildrenGetter = delegate(object x) {
        DirectoryInfo dir = (DirectoryInfo)x;
        return new ArrayList(dir.GetFileSystemInfos());
    };

Remember, `ChildrenGetter` delegates are only ever called if
`CanExpandGetter` returns  *true*, so this delegate knows that the parameter *x* must
be a `DirectoryInfo` instance.

Once you have these two delegates installed, you populate the control by setting
its `Roots` property. Roots are the top level branches of the tree. You can use the `Roots`
property to set these top branches, or you can call `SetObjects()`, which does
the same thing. To add or remove these top level
branches, you can call `AddObjects()` and `RemoveObjects()`, since in a tree view,
these operate on the top level branches.

The `TreeListView` caches the list of children under each branch. This is helpful
when the list of children is expensive to calculate. To force the `TreeListView`
to refetch the list of children, call `RefreshObject()` on the parent.

To see an example of how to use drag and drop on a `TreeListView`, read :ref:`this blog <blog-rearrangingtreelistview>`.

Notes
^^^^^

`CanExpandGetter` is called often! It must be fast. Don't do a database lookup, calculate pi, or 
do linear searches -- just return a property value.

When `CanExpandGetter` and `ChildrenGetter` are called, the `TreeListView` is in an unstable state.
Do not do anything that will callback into the control. 

Both `CanExpandGetter` and `ChildrenGetter` must return immediately. If you can't return immediately,
return a dummy value, do whatever calculation you need, and then called `RefreshObject()` so that the
dummy value is replaced [`RefreshObject()` is thread-safe] Something like this::

    this.treeListView.ChildrenGetter = delegate(object x) {
        var model = (MyModelClass)x;
        if (model.HasChildrenAlready)
            return model.Children;
        if (!model.AlreadyStartedSlowFetch) {
            model.AlreadyStartedSlowFetch = true;
            Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
                model.SlowChildrenFetch();
                this.treeListView.RefreshObject(model);
            });
        }
        return new ArrayList();
    };

Unlearn
^^^^^^^

Do not try to use a `TreeListView` like a standard `TreeView`. They are not the same.

A `TreeListView`
does not have `TreeNodes` that you have to create and then pass to the view.
That's just one more level of unnecessary boiler-plate code -- exactly the
things that `ObjectListView` was written to avoid. 

Instead of creating nodes, think in terms of your data model:

* Can this "thing" be unrolled? 

* When it is unrolled, what list of "things" should be shown?

With that mental mode, `TreeListView` will be much easier to understand and use.


.. _recipe-search:

16. When the user types, I want to be able to match values in a column other than the first one. How can I do that?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have a list that shows medical incidents. One of the columns is
    the doctor responsible for that incident. I'd like the users to be able to sort
    by the "Doctor" column and then type the first few characters of the doctors
    name and find the cases assigned to that doctor. Is there a way to do that?

Surprisingly, yes! If you set `IsSearchOnSortColumn` to  *true* (the default), then characters
typed into the list will be matched against the values of the sort column,
rather than against the values of column 0. iTunes shows this behaviour when you
sort by the "Artist" or "Album" columns.

Remember: this searching works on the string representation of the value, rather than on the values themselves.


.. _recipe-tooltips:

17. How can I show more information in the tooltip when the mouse hovers over a cell?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `ListView` default behaviour is to only use tool tips to show truncated cell
values (even then only when `FullRowSelect` is  *true*). But with an `ObjectListView`,
you are not so limited.

To show a different tooltip when the mouse is over a cell, you should listen for
the `CellToolTipShowing` event. The parameter block for this event tells where
the mouse was, what cell it was over, the model for that row, and the value
that is shown in the cell.

Within that event handler, you can set various properties on the parameter block
to change the tool tip that will be displayed:

* `Text` is the string that will be displayed in the tooltip. If this is null or
  empty, the tool tip will not be shown. Inserting "\\r\\n" sequences into the
  string gives a multi-line tool tip.

* `Font`, `ForeColor` and `BackColor` control the font of the text,
  the text colour and background colour of the tooltip. (NOTE: The colour
  settings do not work under Vista)

* `IsBalloon` allows the tooltip to be shown as a balloon style. (NOTE:
  changing this during an event does not work reliably under Vista.
  Setting it outside of an event works fine).

* `Title` and `StandardIcon` allow a title and icon to be shown above the
  tool tip text.

With a very little bit of work, you can display tool tips like this:

.. image:: images/blog2-balloon2.png

Example::

    this.olv.CellToolTipShowing += new EventHandler<ToolTipShowingEventArgs>(olv_CellToolTipShowing);
    ...
    void olv_CellToolTipShowing(object sender, ToolTipShowingEventArgs e) {
        // Show a long tooltip over cells only when the control key is down
        if (Control.ModifierKeys == Keys.Control) {
            Song s = (Song)x;
            e.Text = String.Format("{0}\r\n{1}\r\n{2}", s.Title, s.Artist, s.Album);
        }
    };

If you change the properties in the parameter block, those properties will only
affect that one showing of a tooltip. If you want to change all tooltips, you
would set the properties of `ObjectListView.CellToolTipControl.` So, if you
want all tooltips to be shown in Tahoma 14 point, you would do this::

    this.olv.CellToolTipControl.Font = new Font("Tahoma", 14);

Similarly, to show a tooltip for a column header, you listen for a
`HeaderToolTipShowing` event.

Previous versions used delegates to provide a subset of this functionality.
These delegates -- `CellToolTipGetter` and `HeaderToolTipGetter` delegates --
still function, but the events provide much great scope for customisation.

All of this extra functionality comes with a small cost. This functionality is
beyond what a standard .NET `ToolTip` can provide. Because of this, you cannot
assign a standard `ToolTip` to an `ObjectListView` in the IDE. Well, actually
you can (at least until I can figure out how to prevent it) but you shouldn't.
If you do, you will get an assertion error the first time a tooltip tries to
show.


.. _recipe-hottracking:

18. How can I emphasise the row under the mouse?
------------------------------------------------

This is called "hot tracking". The normal `ListView` can underline the text of the
row under the mouse. `ObjectListView` can do much more.

Hot tracking is controlled by an instance of `HotItemStyle`. You create and
configure these in the IDE as non-visual components. Once you have created an
instance, you can assign it to the `HotItemStyle` property of the
`ObjectListView`. The same style instance can be shared between various
`ObjectListViews`, making it easier for your application to behave consistently.

A `HotItemStyle` can set the text color, background color, font, and/or font style
of the row under the cursor. If `FullRowSelect` is *true*, these properties will
be applied to all cells of the hot row. If `FullRowSelect` is *false*, background
color will be applied to all cells, but the other properties will only be applied
to cell 0.

`HotItemStyle` also have `Decoration` and `Overlay` properties. These allow
you easily add a decoration to the hot row, as well as display an overlay while
there is a hot item.

For example, this puts a translucent border around the row that the cursor
is over::

    // Make the decoration
    RowBorderDecoration rbd = new RowBorderDecoration();
    rbd.BorderPen = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(128, Color.LightSeaGreen), 2);
    rbd.BoundsPadding = new Size(1, 1);
    rbd.CornerRounding = 4.0f;

    // Put the decoration onto the hot item
    this.olv1.HotItemStyle = new HotItemStyle();
    this.olv1.HotItemStyle.Decoration = rbd;

There is a static property `ObjectListView.DefaultHotItemStyle`. This style is used by default
when no specific `HotItemStyle` is set. This is shared across all `ObjectListView`.

.. _recipe-overlays:

19. How can I put an image (or some text) over the top of the ListView?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is called an "overlay." A normal `ObjectListView` comes pre-equipped with
two overlays ready to use: `OverlayImage` and `OverlayText`. These can be
configured from within the IDE, controlling what image (or text) is displayed,
the corner in which the overlay is shown, and its inset from the control edge.

`TextOverlays` can be further customised, by controlling the color and font
of the text, the color of the background, the width and color of the border,
and whether the border should have rounded corners. All these properties
are controllable from inside the IDE.

If you want to do something other than show a simple image or text, you
can implement the `IOverlay` interface. This interface is very simple::

    public interface IOverlay {
        void Draw(ObjectListView olv, Graphics g, Rectangle r);
    }

Within the `Draw()` method, your implementation can draw whatever it likes.

Once you have implemented this interface, you add it to an `ObjectListView`
via the `AddOverlay()` method::

    MyFantasticOverlay myOverlay = new MyFantasticOverlay();
    myOverlay.ConfigureToDoAmazingThings();
    this.objectListView1.AddOverlay(myOverlay);

Overlays are actually quite tricky to implement. If you use your `ObjectListView`
in a "normal" way (design your interface through the IDE using normal WinForm
controls), they will work flawlessly.

However, if you do "clever" things with your `ObjectListViews`, you
may need to read this: :ref:`overlays-label`. "Clever" in this case
means re-parenting the ObjectListView after it has been created, or
hiding it by rearranging the windows z-ordering. You may also need
to read that if the `ObjectListView` is hosted by a non-standard
TabControl-like container.

Overlays are purely cosmetic. They do not respond to any user interactions.

Disabling
^^^^^^^^^

Overlays look simple but are quite complex underneath. If they seem to be misbehaving
(e.g. if you are seeing `GlassPanelForms` in placing where you don't want them),
you can completely disable overlays by setting `UseOverlays` to *false*.


.. _recipe-decorations:

20. How can I put an image (or some text) over the top of a row or cell?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decorations are similar to overlays in that they are drawn over the top of the
`ObjectListView`, but decoration are different in that they are attached to
a row or cell and scroll with it. Here the love heart and the "Missing!" are
decorations.

.. image:: images/decorations-example.png

Decorations are normally assigned to a row or cell during a `FormatRow` or
`FormatCell` event. In the demo, a love heart appears next to someone
named "Nicola"::

    private void listViewComplex_FormatCell(object sender, FormatCellEventArgs e) {
        Person p = (Person)e.Model;

        // Put a love heart next to Nicola's name :)
        if (e.ColumnIndex == 0) {
            if (p.Name.ToLowerInvariant().StartsWith("nicola")) {
                e.SubItem.Decoration = new ImageDecoration(Resource1.loveheart, 64);
            } else
                e.SubItem.Decoration = null;
        }
    }

The "Missing!" decoration is actually a combination of two decorations and is
done like this::

    if (e.ColumnIndex == 1 && e.SubItem.Text == "") {
        // Add a opaque, rotated text decoration
        TextDecoration decoration = new TextDecoration("Missing!", 255);
        decoration.Alignment = ContentAlignment.MiddleCenter;
        decoration.Font = new Font(this.Font.Name, this.Font.SizeInPoints+2);
        decoration.TextColor = Color.Firebrick;
        decoration.Rotation = -20;
        e.SubItem.Decoration = decoration; //NB. Sets Decoration

        // Put a border around the cell.
        CellBorderDecoration cbd = new CellBorderDecoration();
        cbd.BorderPen = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(128, Color.Firebrick));
        cbd.FillBrush = null;
        cbd.CornerRounding = 4.0f;
        e.SubItem.Decorations.Add(cbd); // N.B. Adds to Decorations
    }

Note that when we put a border around the cell, the code added it to
`Decorations` property. Doing this adds a second decoration to the same cell. If
the code set the `Decoration` property, it would replace the text decoration
that had just been given.

Decorations can also be attached to the hot item. Set the `Decoration` property
of the `HotItemStyle` to something that will be drawn over the hot row/cell.
See :ref:`recipe-hottracking`.

Decorations can also be attached to the selected rows. Set `SelectedRowDecoration`
property of the `ObjectListView` to a decoration, and that decoration will be draw
over each selected row. This draws a translucent green border around each
selected row::

    RowBorderDecoration rbd = new RowBorderDecoration();
    rbd.BorderPen = new Pen(Color.FromArgb(128, Color.Green), 2);
    rbd.BoundsPadding = new Size(0, -1);
    rbd.CornerRounding = 12.0f;
    this.olv1.SelectedRowDecoration = rbd;

Like overlays, decorations are purely cosmetic. They do not respond to any user interactions.


.. _recipe-dragdrop:

21. How can I use drag and drop in an ObjectListView?
-----------------------------------------------------

This needs its own page to explain properly. :ref:`dragdrop-label`.

To see a detailed walk-through, have a look at :ref:`this blog <blog-rearrangingtreelistview>`.

.. _recipe-columntinting:

22. How do I make the sorted column have that slightly different colour?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you set `TintSortColumn` property to *true*, the sort column will be
automatically tinted. The color of the tinting is controlled by the
`SelectedColumnTint` property.

You can tint a different column (other than the sort column) by setting the
`SelectedColumn` property, or by installing `TintedColumnDecoration` for the
column that you want to color::

    this.objectListView1.AddDecoration(new TintedColumnDecoration(columnToTint));

This latter option lets you tint more than one column.


.. _recipe-imageonlycolumn:

23. How do I make a column that shows just an image?
----------------------------------------------------

    *I want to show a meetings room's availability as an icon, without any text.
    What's the best way to do that?*

To show only an image in a column, do this::

   this.meetingColumn.AspectGetter = delegate(object x) {
       return ((MeetingRoom)x).Availability;
   };
   this.meetingColumn.AspectToStringConverter = delegate(object x) {
       return String.Empty;
   };
   this.meetingColumn.ImageGetter = delegate(object x) {
       switch (((MeetingRoom)x).Availability) {
           case RoomAvailability.Free: return "free";
           case RoomAvailability.InUse: return "inuse";
           case RoomAvailability.Booked: return "booked";
       }
       return "unexpected";
   };

By returning an aspect, sorting and grouping will still work. By forcing
`AspectToStringConverter` to return an empty string, no string will be drawn,
only the image.

This works in both owner drawn or non-owner drawn lists.


.. _recipe-rightclickmenu:

24. How do I show a menu when the user right clicks on the ObjectListView?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to show the same menu, regardless of where the user clicks,
you can simply assign that menu to the `ContextMenuStrip` property of the `ObjectListView`
(this is standard .NET, nothing specific to an `ObjectListView`).

If you want to show a context menu specific to the object clicked,
you can listen for `CellRightClick` events::

    private void olv_CellRightClick(object sender, CellRightClickEventArgs e) {
        e.MenuStrip = this.DecideRightClickMenu(e.Model, e.Column);
    }

If `MenuStrip` is not null, it will be shown where the mouse was clicked.

It's entirely reasonable for `e.Model` to be *null*. That means the user clicked
on the list background.


.. _recipe-headerformatting:

25. How do I change the font or color of the column headers?
------------------------------------------------------------

Set `ObjectListView.HeaderUsesThemes` to *false* and then create
a `HeaderFormatStyle` object (either in code or within the IDE), give it
the characteristics you want, and then assign that style to either
`ObjectListView.HeaderFormatStyle` (to format all column headers) or
`OLVColumn.HeaderFormatStyle` (to format just one column header).

Each `HeaderFormatStyle` has a setting for each state of the header:

* `Normal` controls how the header appears when nothing else is happening to it.

* `Hot` controls how the header appears when the mouse is over the header.
  This should be a slight, but still noticeable, shift from the normal state.

* `Pressed` controls how the header appears when the user has pressed the
  mouse button on the header, but not yet released the button.
  This should be a clear visual change from both the normal and hot states.

For each state, the header format allows the font, font color, background color
and frame to be specified. If you combine these attributes badly, you can
produce some truly dreadful designs, but when well used, the effect can be pleasant.

    *"I've set up the HeaderFormat like you say, but the stupid thing does nothing"*

Make sure `HeaderUsesThemes` is *false*. If this is *true*, `ObjectListView` will
use the OS's theme to draw the header, ignoring the `HeaderFormatStyle` completely.

There is also `ObjectListView.HeaderWordWrap` which when *true* says to
word wrap the text within the header.

.. image:: images/header-formatting.png



.. _recipe-hyperlink:

26. How do I show a hyperlink in a cell?
----------------------------------------

To put a hyperlink into a cell, you have to:

1. Set `UseHyperlinks` to  *true* on the `ObjectListView`.
2. Set `Hyperlink` to  *true* on the column that you want.

After these two steps, every non-empty cell in the column will be treated as a
hyperlink.

If you only want some of the cells to be hyperlinks, you can listen for the
`IsHyperlink` event. This event is triggered once for every hyperlink cell, and
allows the programmer to control the URL that is associated with the link (by
default, the text of the cell is regarded as the URL). If the `Url` property is
set to null or empty, then that cell will not be treated as a hyperlink.

If you are already listening for the `FormatCell`
you could also set the `URL` property of the `OLVListSubItem` in that event.

Just to be complete, when a hyperlink is clicked, `ObjectListView` triggers a
`HyperlinkClickd` event (no prizes for guessing that). If you listen for and
handle this event, set `Handled` to true so that the default processing is not
done. By default, `ObjectListView` will try to open the URL, using
`System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()`

Finally, the appearance of all hyperlinks is controlled by the `HyperlinkStyle`
property. In most cases, the default settings will work fine.


.. _recipe-groupformatting:

27. How do I put an image next to a group heading?
--------------------------------------------------

On XP, you can't. Groups on XP get a header and that is all.

But on Vista and later, to display an image against a group header, you need to
set `GroupImageList` on the `ObjectListView`. This is the image list from which the
group header images will be taken. Then on the group itself, you need to set `TitleImage`
to either the index or name of the image to show.

There isn't a `GetGroupTitleImage` delegate. Instead, there are two more general
manners to handle this:

* You can listen for the `AboutToCreateGroups` event, which passes in all the groups that are
  to be created. Within the event handler, you can make changes to the groups, their order
  and even their presence! You can also add new groups if you so wish.

* The `OLVColumn.GroupFormatter` delegate is called once for each new group
  before it is added to the control. Within it, you can change the group
  formatting, including the title, subtitle, footer and task. These changes
  overwrite any changes made within the `AboutToCreateGroups` event.

These mechanisms are more useful than a `GetGroupTitleImage` delegate, since
they allow any or all of the group information to be altered, not just the
`TitleImage`.


.. _recipe-grouptask:

28. How do I use that little clicky thing next to a group header?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

That "little clicky thing" is called the group task.  You set it through the
`GroupTask` property during the `AboutToCreateGroups` event or  `GroupFormatter`
delegate (see :ref:`recipe-groupformatting`).

.. image:: images/group-formatting.png

In this snapshot, the "Check bank balance" is the group task.

When the user clicks on  the text, `ObjectListView` triggers a  `GroupTaskClick`
event. This event contains the group whose task was clicked.

[Once again, this is not possible on XP]


.. _recipe-generator:

29. Can I generate the whole `ObjectListView` directly from my model?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    *I'm writing software to a merchant bank and time to market is crucial.
    Is there a way I create a working ObjectListView just using my model class?*

Funnily enough, yes, you can -- I'm glad you asked.

The basic idea is that you give your model class to `Generator` class and it
create columns for the public properties of your model.
If you want to have more control over the generated columns,
you can decorate your model's properties with a
`OLVColumn` attribute.

The `Generator` class looks at the public properties of a class and
generates columns for them. So, this line would
generate columns in the `this.olv1` ObjectListView for all the public
properties of `MyModelClass`::

    Generator.GenerateColumns(this.olv1, typeof(MyModelClass), true);

There are a couple of flavours of `GenerateColumns()`. This next one
looks at the first member of `myListOfObjects`, and based on its type,
generates the columns of `this.olv1`::

    Generator.GenerateColumns(this.olv1, this.myListOfObjects);

So, if there was a foreign exchange management application, one of its model classes
might look like this::

    public class ForexTransaction {
        public DateTime When { get; set; }
        public decimal Rate { get; set; }
        public Currency FromCurrency { get; set; }
        public Currency ToCurrency { get; set; }
        public decimal FromValue { get; set; }
        public decimal ToValue { get; set; }
        public string UserId { get; set; }
    }

So to generate columns for this class, you would do this::

    Generator.GenerateColumns(this.olv1, typeof(ForexTransaction), true);

This would generate reasonable, but boring, columns:

.. image:: images/generator-boring.png

If you want to make the
columns more interesting, you can give them an `OLVColumn` attributes.
Most properties of
`OLVColumn` instances can be set through the `OLVColumn` attributes::

    public class ForexTransaction {

        [OLVColumn(Width = 150)]
        public DateTime When { get; set; }

        [OLVColumn(DisplayIndex = 5, Width = 75, TextAlign = HorizontalAlignment.Right)]
        public decimal Rate { get; set; }

        [OLVColumn("From", DisplayIndex=1, Width = 50, TextAlign = HorizontalAlignment.Center)]
        public string FromCurrency { get; set; }

        [OLVColumn("To", DisplayIndex = 3, Width = 50, TextAlign = HorizontalAlignment.Center)]
        public string ToCurrency { get; set; }

        [OLVColumn("Amount", DisplayIndex = 2, AspectToStringFormat = "{0:C}", Width = 75, TextAlign = HorizontalAlignment.Right)]
        public decimal FromValue { get; set; }

        [OLVColumn("Amount", DisplayIndex = 4, AspectToStringFormat = "{0:C}", Width = 75, TextAlign = HorizontalAlignment.Right)]
        public decimal ToValue { get; set; }

        [OLVColumn(IsVisible = false)]
        public string UserId { get; set; }
    }

`DisplayIndex` governs the ordering of the columns.

This gives a slightly more interesting control:

[Thanks to John Kohler for this idea and the original implementation]


.. _recipe-vistascheme:

30. Can the `ObjectListView` use a selection scheme like Vista?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways you can do this:

1. You can set `UseTransluscentSelection` and `UseTranslucentHotItem` to  *true*.
   This will give a selection and hot item mechanism that is *similar* to that
   used by Vista. It is not the same, I know. Do not complain.

   This works best when the control is owner drawn. When the list is not owner
   drawn, the native control uses its default selection scheme in addition to
   those use by these settings. It's still acceptable, but doesn't look quite so good.

2. You can set `UseExplorerTheme` to *true*. If you absolutely have to look like
   Vista, this is your property. But it has quite a few limitations (and may mess
   up other things I haven't yet discovered):

* It only works on Vista and later.
* It does nothing when `OwnerDraw` is *true*. Owner drawn lists are (naturally) controlled by their renderers.
* It does not work well with `AlternateRowBackColors`.
* It does not play well with `HotItemStyles`.
* It looks a bit silly when `FullRowSelect` is *false*.


.. _recipe-virtualgroups:

31. Can I show groups on a virtual list?
----------------------------------------

If it is on XP or earlier, no. If the program is running on Vista or later, yes -- but
you may have to do some work.

A `FastObjectListView` supports groups as it stands. Simple set `ShowGroups`
to *true*, and it will handle groups just like a normal `ObjectListView`. End of
story, case closed.

If you have your own `VirtualObjectListView`, you have to do a little bit more
work to enable groups on your control. You need set the `GroupStrategy` property
to an object which implement the `IVirtualGroups` interface.

The `IVirtualGroups` interface looks like this::

    public interface IVirtualGroups
    {
        // Return the list of groups that should be shown according to the given parameters
        IList<OLVGroup> GetGroups(GroupingParameters parameters);

        // Return the index of the item that appears at the given position within the given group.
        int GetGroupMember(OLVGroup group, int indexWithinGroup);

        // Return the index of the group to which the given item belongs
        int GetGroup(int itemIndex);

        // Return the index at which the given item is shown in the given group
        int GetIndexWithinGroup(OLVGroup group, int itemIndex);

        // A hint that the given range of items are going to be required
        void CacheHint(int fromGroupIndex, int fromIndex, int toGroupIndex, int toIndex);
    }

All members must be fully implemented except `CacheHint()` which is only a hint.

`GetGroups()` is the key function. It must return a list of `OLVGroup` in the
order in which they should be created in the listview. Each `OLVGroup` must have
at least `Header` and `VirtualItemCount` properties initialized.

Like a virtual list, virtual groups do not keep a list of the items they
contain. Instead, each group knows how many items it contains
(`VirtualItemCount` property) and can tell which item is at a given index within
it. The `GetGroupMember()` has that responsibility: for a given group, this
method must figure out what item is at the n'th position of that group. It then
returns the index of that item in the overall list.

`GetGroup()` does a semi-inverse operation: given the index of an item in the
overall list, return the index of the group to which that item belongs.

`GetIndexWithinGroup()` does the other half of the inverse operation: once we
know what group an item belongs to, this member return its index within that
group.

Be aware: `GetGroup()` and `GetGroupMember()` are called *often*.
They have to be fast. They cannot do database lookup or queries against DNS.
They can do a couple of indexed lookups and that is all!

Even then, the grouping on virtual lists will still hit limits. It works
perfectly with 10,000 rows, works acceptably with 50,000, but on my laptop,
showing groups on virtual lists with more than 100,000 rows was not usable. It
seems that in some situations (for example, while scrolling) the control runs
through all the rows (or a good chunk of them), asking which group each row
belongs to. It does this quickly, but running through a 100,000 rows still takes
some time.

One other problem is caused by the normal behaviour of a grouped listview:
when the user clicks a group header, the listview control selects
all the members of that group. This is fine if the group has 100 or even 200 rows,
but if the group has 20,000 items in it, it will select each one,
triggering 20,000 `SelectedIndexChanged` events -- which is a pain!

Caveat emptor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Implementing this feature required the use of undocumented features. That means
there is no guarantee that it will continue working in later versions of Windows
(or even on current versions). You have been warned.


.. _recipe-filtering:

32. Can I filter the contents of the ObjectListView?
----------------------------------------------------

This needs a :ref:`whole page to itself <filtering-label>`.

In brief, you must set `UseFiltering` to *true*, and then set either the `ModelFilter` property
or the `ListFilter` property to an appropriate filter.

ObjectListView provides a number
of pre-built filter, including a text based filter (see :ref:`recipe-text-filtering`).
The base `ModelFilter` class can be given a delegate and used directly::

   this.olv1.ModelFilter = new ModelFilter(delegate(object x) {
       return ((PhoneCall)x).IsEmergency;
   });

If you want your filter to co-operate with any :ref:`Excel-like filtering <column-filtering-label>`,
set the `AdditionalFilter` property, instead of the `ModelFilter`.

.. _recipe-text-filtering:

33. Is there an easy way to only show rows that contain some text?
------------------------------------------------------------------

    *I want to do a text filter like iTunes' search box, where only songs that contain the typed string are shown. Is there an easy way to do that?*

Funnily enough, there is! It's called `TextMatchFilter.` You use it thus::

    this.olv1.ModelFilter = TextMatchFilter.Contains(this.olv1, "search");

After executing this line, the `olv1` will only show rows where the text "search"
occurs in at least one cell of that row.

This searching uses each cell's string representation. This can lead to some odd, but still
accurate results, when owner drawn is *true*. For example, subitem check boxes are drawn
as boxes, but their string representation is "true" and "false." If you're text filter is
"rue" it will match all rows where a subitem check box is checked. To prevent this,
you can make a column invisible to text filters by setting `Searchable` to *false*.

Alternatively, the filter can be configured to only consider some of the columns in the `ObjectListView` by
setting the `Columns` property. This is useful for avoiding searching on columns that you
know will return nonsensical results (like checkboxes above).

It can also be set up to do regular expression searching::

	this.olv1.ModelFilter = TextMatchFilter.Regex(this.olv1, "^[0-9]+");

Or prefix matching (all these factory methods can accept more than one string)::

	this.olv1.ModelFilter = TextMatchFilter.Prefix(this.olv1, "larry", "moe", "curly");

HighlightTextRenderer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your filtered `ObjectListView` is owner drawn, you can pair this text searching
with a special renderer, `HighlightTextRenderer.` This renderer draws a highlight box
around any substring that matches the given filter. So::

    TextMatchFilter filter = TextMatchFilter.Contains(this.olv1, "er");
    this.olv1.ModelFilter = filter;
    this.olv1.DefaultRenderer = new HighlightTextRenderer(filter);

would give something that looks like this:

.. image:: images/text-filter-highlighting.png

You can change the highlighting by playing with the `CornerRoundness`, `FramePen` and `FillBrush` properties
on the `HighlightTextRenderer.`

If you just want to highlight the text without actually filtering the rows, set the
`DefaultRenderer` but don't set the `ModelFilter` property.

Remember: the list has to be owner drawn for the renderer to have any effect.

.. _recipe-animations:

34. How do I put something animated onto my ObjectListView?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This needs a whole page to itself: :ref:`animations-label`

.. _recipe-state:

35. How can I save and restore the state of the ObjectListView?
---------------------------------------------------------------

    *In my app, I want to remember the ordering and size
    of the columns in the list so they can be restored when
    the user reruns the app. Is there a way to do that?*

Use the `SaveState()` and `RestoreState()` methods.

`SaveState()`
returns a byte array which contains the state of the `ObjectListView`.
Store this where you want (file, XML, registry), and when you next
run your app, reload this byte array and give it to `RestoreState()`.

These methods store the following characteristics:

* current view (i.e. Details, Tile, Large Icon...)
* sort column and direction
* column order
* column widths
* column visibility

It does not include selection or scroll position.

.. _recipe-column-header-image:

36. How can I put an image in the column header?
------------------------------------------------

[The second most requested feature ever]

Set `OLVColumn.HeaderImageKey` to the key of an image from
the ObjectListView's `SmallImageList`. That image will appear to the left
of the text in the header.

.. image:: images/header-with-image.png

For the image to appear `OLVColumn.HeaderUsesTheme` must be *false*. Otherwise,
the header will be drawn strictly in accordance with the OS's current theme
(which certainly will not include an image).

If you only want an image in the header without any text showing,
set `OLVColumn.ShowTextInHeader` to *false*.

Don't use `ImageKey` or `ImageIndex`. These are Microsoft standard
properties, but they don't work. Both are hidden from the code generation
process so any value you set on them in the IDE *will not* be persisted.

.. _recipe-column-header-vertical:

37. Can I make a header take up even less space? Can it be drawn vertical?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For checkbox column, or image only columns, the header text can take up
much more space than the data it is labelling. In such cases, you can make
the columns header be drawn vertically, by setting `OLVColumn.IsHeaderVertical`
property to *true*.

Setting this gives something like this:

.. image:: images/vertical-header.png

The header will expand vertically to draw the entire header text. You can set
a maximum height through the `ObjectListView.HeaderMaximumHeight` property.

Vertical headers are text only. Setting `HeaderImageKey` does nothing.

Vertical text is actually quite hard to read. If you use vertical headers,
be kind to your users and give the header a tool tip (through
the `OLVColumn.HeaderToolTip` property) that lets the user
easily see what the header is trying to say.

.. _recipe-showing-editing-cell:

38. I want to make the cell being edited more obvious
-----------------------------------------------------

   *My users sometimes get confused about whether they are editing a cell,
   and if so, which one. Is there any way to make these things more obvious?*

You could install a `EditingCellBorderDecoration` on your `ObjectListView`.
Then, when the user is editing a cell, they will see something like this:

.. image:: images/cell-editing-border.png

To install this decoration, you do this::

  this.olv.AddDecoration(new EditingCellBorderDecoration { UseLightbox = true });

The `EditingCellBorderDecoration` has the usual swathe of properties controlling
exactly how it looks.

OK, OK. This isn't actually a very useful class, but it does look cool :)

.. _recipe-sorting-groups:

39. How can I change the ordering of groups or rows within a group?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

   *Your way of ordering groups and the rows within the groups is stupid.
   I want to be able to do it myself.*

O-K... Listen for the `BeforeCreatingGroups` event. In the parameter block
for that event, set `GroupComparer` to control how groups are sorted, and
`ItemComparer` to control how items within a group are sorted.

If you don't want the items within the group to be sorted at all, set
`PrimarySortOrder` to `SortOrder.None`.

There is no way to NOT sort the groups. They have to be ordered in some
fashion.

40. How do I change what happens the user presses Tab or Enter when editing a cell?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   *In my app, I want the user to be able to edit all cells just by repeatedly
   hitting [Tab]. So, when the user hits [Tab] when editing the last cell, I don't
   want it to wrap back to the first cell -- I want it to change rows.
   How can do I that?*

There must be a thousand variations on this question, but the two most common are:

1. how to make `[Tab]` change rows when editing the last cell.

2. how to make `[Enter]` change rows, not just commit the change.

To address these two most common case, ObjectListView now has `CellEditTabChangesRows`
and `CellEditEnterChangesRows` properties.

* `CellEditTabChangesRows` makes ObjectListView
  change the row being edited when the user presses `[Tab]` while editing the last
  editable cell on a row.

* `CellEditEnterChangesRows` makes ObjectListView
  try to edit the cell below the cell being edited when the user press `[Enter]`.

These behaviours are achieved by modifying the `CellEditKeyEngine` settings.
This engine allows you to completely
customise the behaviour of keys during a cell edit operation.

For example, to make [Ctrl-Up] start editing the cell above the current cell::

    olv1.CellEditKeyEngine.SetKeyBehaviour(Keys.Up|Keys.Control, CellEditCharacterBehaviour.ChangeRowUp, CellEditAtEdgeBehaviour.ChangeRow);

NOTE: The interface to `CellEditKeyEngine` will almost certainly change in the next version.

41. How do I change the way the "Filtering" menu works?
-------------------------------------------------------

  *I really like the 'Filter' menu, but I want to change the values that are
  shown in the check list. How do I do that?*

This is complex enough to needs its own page (:ref:`column-filtering-label`), but briefly:

The values in the check list are controlled by the `ClusteringStrategy` that is installed on a column.
By default, the clustering strategy copies the grouping behaviour of that column. To change
this, you must set `ClusteringStrategy` to a strategy that does what you want.

To create your own strategy, you must implement `IClusteringStrategy` or subclass
the safe base class `ClusteringStrategy`. If you are showing dates or times in a column,
the `DateTimeClusteringStrategy` can probably be configured to do exactly what you want.

To hide the 'Filter' menu item for all columns, set `ShowFilterMenuOnRightClick` to *false*.

To hide the 'Filter' menu item for a particular column, set `UsesFiltering` to *false* on that column.

.. _recipe-column-selection:

42. How can I change the way the user can choose the columns in an ObjectListView?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, the user is able to select which columns they wish to see in an `ObjectListView`.
The user interface mechanism for this is that when the user right clicks on any header,
they will presented with a menu that lets them choose which columns they wish to see.

The exact behaviour of the column selection mechanism is governed
by the `SelectColumnsOnRightClickBehaviour` property.

To prevent the user from changes the visible columns, set this property to `ColumnSelectBehaviour.None`.

To present the column selection menu as a submenu off the header right click menu,
set this property to `ColumnSelectBehaviour.Submenu`.

.. image:: images/column-selection-submenu.png

To present the column selection menu as the bottom items in the header right click menu,
set this property to `ColumnSelectBehaviour.Inline`. This is the default.
If `SelectColumnsMenuStaysOpen` is *true* (which is the default),
the menu will remain open after the user
clicks on column, letting them hide or show multiple columns without having to show
the right click menu again.

.. image:: images/column-selection-inline.png

To present the user with a dialog that lets them choose the columns (as well as rearrange
the order of the columns), set this property to `ColumnSelectBehaviour.ModelDialog`.

.. image:: images/column-selection-modaldialog.png

If there are some columns that you do not want the user to be able to hide, set
`OLVColumn.Hideable` to *false*. This will prevent the user from hiding that column.

Note: Column 0 can never be hidden. This is a limit of the underlying Windows control.
If you wish to make your first column hide-able, move it to anywhere else in the column list,
and then set its `DisplayIndex` to 0, so that it appears first.


.. _recipe-persistent-checkboxes:

43. How can I make checkboxes keep their values when filtering an ObjectListView?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set `PersistentCheckboxes` to *true* (this is the default).

The "checkedness" of a row is maintained by the underlying ListView control.
However, when the contents of the control are rebuild -- either by calling `BuildList()`
or by applying or removing a filter --
this "checkedness" is lost since all the underlying `ListViewItems` are destroyed and recreated.

When `PersistentCheckboxes` is *true*, the `ObjectListView` will remember the check state of
each row, and ensure that it is correctly maintained whenever the list is rebuilt or filtered.

If an `ObjectListView` has `CheckStateGetter` and `CheckStatePutters` installed, the `PersistentCheckboxes`
property does nothing, since the getter and putter must already persist the checkbox state.

This behaviour is new in v2.5.1. To revert to the previous behaviour, set `PersistentCheckboxes` to *false*.

.. _recipe-cancel-group-expand:

44. How can I stop the user expanding/collapsing a group?
---------------------------------------------------------

Listen for the `GroupExpandingCollapsing` event, and then set `Canceled` to *true* if the event should be prevented.

This handler will stop a group from expanding if the group starts with "NO_EXPAND"::

    private void olv1_GroupExpandingCollapsing(object sender, GroupExpandingCollapsingEventArgs e) {
        e.Canceled = e.IsExpanding && e.Group.Header.StartsWith("NO_EXPAND");
    }

.. _recipe-native-backgrounds:

45. How do I put a *real* background image onto an ObjectListView?
------------------------------------------------------------------

    *That overlay stuff is just too tricky. I want a real background image
    and I want it now!*

Since XP, the native ListView control has supported background images via the `LVM_SETBKIMAGE` message.
But it has always had serious limits, as this screen shot shows:

.. image:: images/setbkimage.png

This is less than ideal. Column 0 always draw over the background image, as do subitem images and grid lines.
It was these limitations that lead to the creation of overlays.

However, Windows 7 seems to have improved this situation:

.. image:: images/setbkimage2.png

Better but still not perfect. The limitations are still there:

* It doesn't look very good when grid lines are enabled, since the grid lines are still drawn over the image.
* It doesn't work with owner drawn mode. In owner drawn mode, each cell draws itself, including its background, which covers the background image.
* The transparent areas of the background image aren't completely transparent.
* It looks odd when alternate row background colors are enabled.
* This for Windows 7, so obviously, it does not work at all on XP.

If you can live with these limits, `ObjectListView` now [v2.5.1] has built in support for native backgrounds::

    // Set a watermark in the bottom right of the control
    this.olv.SetNativeBackgroundWatermark(Resource1.redback1);

    // Set the background image positioned 50% horizontally and 75% vertically
    this.olv.SetNativeBackgroundImage(Resource1.redback1, 50, 75));

    // Set a tiled background to the control
    this.olv.SetNativeBackgroundTiledImage(Resource1.limeleaf);

Apart from these limitations, native watermarks are quite neat. They are true backgrounds, not
translucent overlays like the `OverlayImage` uses. They also have the decided advantage over overlays in that
they work correctly even in MDI applications.

.. _recipe-databinding:

46. How do I bind a `DataSet` to an `ObjectListView`?
-----------------------------------------------------

Each flavour of control has a data bindable version:

* `ObjectListView` => `DataListView`
* `FastObjectListView` => `FastDataListView`
* `TreeListView` =>  `DataTreeListView`

Each data bindable version has two additional properties: `DataSource` and `DataMember`.
These let you control which data set is bound to the control. These operates as they
would for .NET's `DataView`.

`DataTreeListView` requires some more configuration. :ref:`See the next recipe <recipe-datatreelistview>`.

When setting `DataSource`, the provided value should implement either `IList`, `IBindingList`,
or `IListSource`. Some common examples are the following types of objects:

* `DataView`
* `DataTable`
* `DataSet`
* `DataViewManager`
* `BindingSource`

When binding to a list container (i.e. one that implements the
`IListSource` interface, such as `DataSet`)
you must also set the `DataMember` property in order
to identify which particular list you would like to display. You
may also set the `DataMember` property even when
DataSource refers to a list, since `DataMember` can
also be used to navigate relations between lists.

All of the following will show the "Persons" table from the data set::

  DataSet ds = LoadDataset();

  if (ds == null || ds.Tables.Count == 0)
    return;

  // Install a DataTable
  this.olvData.DataSource = ds.Tables["Person"];

  // Install a DataView
  this.olvData.DataSource = new DataView(ds.Tables["Person"]);

  // Use DataSet directly
  this.olvData.DataMember = "Person";
  this.olvData.DataSource = ds;

  // Use a DataViewManager
  this.olvData.DataMember = "Person";
  this.olvData.DataSource = new DataViewManager(ds);

  // Install a BindingSource
  this.olvData.DataSource = new BindingSource(ds, "Person");

Obviously, in the real world, you would only use one of these calls.

Automatic column creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using data binding will create columns in the `ObjectListView` for all columns in the data source.

If you don't want any automatic column creation, set `AutoGenerateColumns` to `false` *before*
setting the `DataSource`.

ListView columns will only be created if one doesn't already exist for that dataset column. If
you want to set up a fancy column to show the "UserName" column from the database, you could create
a column in the `ObjectListView` in the IDE's Designer, and set `AspectName` to "UserName." The data binding
process will see that there is already a column for "UserName" and not create a new one.

Other bits and pieces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If there is a data column in the `DataSet` that you don't want to display, create a column in the `ObjectListView`,
set the `AspectName` to the name of the data column and mark that column as `IsVisible` = *false*.

If you wanted to use a navigator and synchronize several data bound
controls, you will need a `BindingSource` and something like this::

  BindingSource bs = new BindingSource(ds, "Person");
  this.bindingNavigator1.BindingSource = bs;
  this.dataGridView1.DataSource = bs;
  this.dataListView1.DataSource = bs;

.. _recipe-datatreelistview:

47. Why can't I data-bind the `TreeListView`?
---------------------------------------------

    *I want a TreeListView but I'm basically too lazy to even lift a
    schooner to my mouth. Can't you make it so I don't have to write even
    a single line of code?*

I actually received an email that said this -- well, alright, maybe the words were slightly
different, but the meaning was the same.

So, as of v2.6, there is now a `DataTreeListView` -- a data bindable `TreeListView`.

In order to construct a `DataTreeListView`, the control needs three pieces of data, which can all
be set in the Designer:

* name of the column that hold the unique id of each row -- `KeyAspectName`
* name of the column that hold the id of the parent of each row -- `ParentKeyAspectName`
* the value that indicates a row is a top level row in the control (a root) -- `RootKeyValue`

Imagine we have a table that looks like this:

.. image:: images/dtlv-table.png

To show this table, the `DataTreeListView` would be configured like this:

========================   ==============
  Property                 Value
========================   ==============
  `KeyAspectName`          "Id"
  `ParentKeyAspectName`    "ParentId"
  `RootKeyValue`           0
========================   ==============

This says, the unique of each row can be found in the "Id" column. The
"ParentId" holds the parent id of each row. And the value "0" in the "ParentId" column indicates
that the row should be shown a top level root.

Combining that table with a `DataTreeListView` configured like this would give this:

.. image:: images/dtlv-hierarchy.png

The rows that have "0" in the "ParentId" column are the roots of the tree, so
"Jonathan Piper" and "Bill Gates" are the roots.

All rows that have "1" (the "Id" of "Jonathan Piper") in their "ParentId" cell
will appear as child rows of "Jonthan Piper". Similarly, all rows that have "6"
in their "ParentId" cell will appear as child rows of "Bill Gates".

Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

`DataTreeListView` are slow! 

Since the control know nothing about the underlying data structures,
it has to do linear searches for every get children or get parent operation. This is fine 
for a table with a couple of hundred rows, but will be painful if there are a couple of thousand.

If you are going to have thousands of rows, don't use a `DataTreeListView`. Do the work of creating
model objects and display them in a normal `TreeListView`. That control *is* fast, and can handle
tens of thousands of rows without breaking into a sweat :)

Other bits and pieces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hierarchy
must be strictly self-referential. All the information it needs must be within
the table itself.
This control does not handle joins to other tables.
If you want to do something like that, make  a VIEW
that holds all the data you want to display and then bind to that view.

Many times, the columns that hold the identity and parent keys are not really
meant for end user consumption. If you want those columns to be hidden from
the user, you can set `ShowKeyColumns` to *false* before binding the control
to a data source. Setting this after binding has no effect.

Due to the limitations of the Designer in the IDE, `RootKeyValue` can only be
given a string value through the IDE. If your `ParentKey` is not of type string,
you will have to set its value through code.

`null` is a valid value for `RootKeyValue`. 


.. _recipe-hierarchical-checkboxes:

48. Can a `TreeListView` calculate checkboxes based on subitems?
----------------------------------------------------------------

    *I'd like the TreeListView to be able to check everything
    in a branch if the top of the branch is checked.*

As of v2.7, `TreeListView` has the ability to do hierarchical checkboxes.

Hierarchical checkboxes is that neat ability where the checked-ness of a branch 
summarizes the checked-ness of all its subitems. If the branch is checked, the user 
knows that everything under that branch is checked. If the branch is unchecked, 
then similarly everything under that branch is unchecked. If the branch is indeterminate, 
the user knows that there is a mix of checked and unchecked items within that branch.

.. image:: images/hierarchical-checkboxes-1.png

In the above screenshot, the "dell" folder is checked because all its contents are checked.
The "android" folder is indeterminate, since some of its children are checked and some aren't.

To enable this feature, set `HierarchicalCheckBoxes` to `true`. You may need to install a `ParentGetter` 
delegate, which lets the control calculate the ancestors of any object, even if that object isn't 
currently in the control.

Once this is true, when the user checks a branch, all items under that branch will be
checked as well. When an branch is unchecked, all the items under that branch will be
unchecked too.

`CheckedObjects` will behave somewhat differently. It will return:

* all objects which were specifically checked by the user
* all objects that were set in the `CheckedObjects` collection, and that have not been unchecked by the user
* all objects whose ancestor was checked by the user AND that have been made visible in the control

For example, with the above snapshot, `CheckedObjects` would return::
  
  {"adb.exe", "fastboot.exe", "dell", "StageEula", "DBRM.ini", "OOBEDONE.flag", "welcome.reg"}

If "StageEula" had been expanded at some point, its contents would also be included in 
`CheckedObjects` -- even if "StageEula" wasn't expanded at the moment.

If you set `CheckedObjects` *and* any of those objects haven't already been revealed in the
`TreeListView`, then the control will not know where it fits in the hierarchy, and so won't 
be able to calculate the check state of its ancestors. To get around this, you have to install
a `ParentGetter` delegate. If this don't make much sense to you, don't worry about it.

Hierarchical checkboxes don't work with `CheckStateGetters` or `CheckStateSetters`. Just 
don't use them.

.. _recipe-disabled-rows:

49. Can rows be disabled?
----------------------------------------------------------------

As of v2.8, all flavours of `ObjectListView` can have disabled rows.

.. image:: images/blog8-allgrey.png

Disabled rows cannot be selected, activated, edited or checked. They can be focused
(to know why, see this blog entry: :ref:`blog-disabledrows`).
They are also visually distinct (often grey text with greyscale images).

To disable some model objects, call `DisableObjects()`. To enable them again,
call `EnableObjects()`. These both have single object versions. To get or set
the entire collection of disabled models, use the `DisabledObjects` property.

To change the appearance of disabled rows, make a `SimpleRowStyle` and assign it to `DisabledRowStyle`.
If we were using a dark theme, this style might be more appropriate (except the font, which is just 
being silly)::

    this.olv.DisabledItemStyle = new SimpleItemStyle();
    this.olv.DisabledItemStyle.ForeColor = Color.Gray;
    this.olv.DisabledItemStyle.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(30, 30, 35);
    this.olv.DisabledItemStyle.Font = new Font("Stencil", 10);

Disabled rows when not owner drawn
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Obviously, the underlying ListView control doesn't actually support disabling rows.
`ObjectListView` has to do a lot of work to make the ListView control look as if it can.

As such, disabled rows look best when owner drawn (the above snapshot is in owner drawn mode). 
In non-owner drawn mode, the row is disabled, but it doesn't look completely as if it is.
The images and check boxes are drawn normally and look as if they can be used (but they can't).

.. _recipe-checkbox-in-header:

50. How can I put a checkbox in a column header?
------------------------------------------------

Also as of v2.8, column headers can have a checkbox:

.. image:: images/column-headercheckbox-1.png

Configuring
^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable a checkbox on a header, set `OLVColumn.HeaderCheckBox` to `true`. 

If you want a tri-state checkbox, set  `OLVColumn.HeaderTriStateCheckBox` to `true`. 

You can determine the state of a header checkbox via `OLVColumn.HeaderCheckState`.

Header checkboxes can also be disabled, by setting `OLVColumn.HeaderCheckBoxDisabled` to `true`. 

As with all header customization, you will only see the checkboxes if `ObjectListView.HeaderUsesTheme` is `false`.

In action
^^^^^^^^^

Once a column has a checkbox in its header, you control it through:

- `ObjectListView.CheckHeaderCheckBox(OLVColumn col)`
- `ObjectListView.CheckIndeterminateHeaderCheckBox(OLVColumn col)`
- `ObjectListView.ToggleHeaderCheckBox(OLVColumn col)`
- `ObjectListView.UncheckHeaderCheckBox(OLVColumn col)`

When the user clicks on the checkbox (or when you call the above methods), ObjectListView will fire a `HeaderCheckBoxChanging`
event. This message can be cancelled.

If the header checkbox is disabled and the user clicks on it, an event will still be fired (giving you the chance to
perhaps explain to the user why the checkbox is disabled), but by default it will not change anything.

Updating cell checkboxes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A useful feature is to have the checkbox in the header control the checkboxes in the cells of that column.
Checking the header will check all the cells under that header. 
Unsurprisingly, unchecking the header will uncheck all the cells under that header. 
Of course, this only makes sense if the
column has checkboxes in its cells. To enabled this feature, set `OLVColumn.HeaderCheckBoxUpdatesRowCheckBoxes`
to `true`.

This updating is only one way: from the header down to the cells. There is (currently) no feature to do
the reverse -- recalculate the checkedness of the header based on the checkedness of the cells.

Hit testing and CellOver events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hit testing on a ObjectListView has been extended to include information about the header. The hit testing
logic can now report header locations:

- `HitTestLocation.Header`
- `HitTestLocation.HeaderCheckBox`
- `HitTestLocation.HeaderDivider`

On `OlvListViewHitTestInfo`, `ColumnIndex` and `HeaderDividerIndex` tell exactly which column or divider was hit.

Changed in mouse location are primarily reported through `CellOver` events. These events are now also raised
when the mouse moves over the header. Since this is different from previous versions, this behaviour can be 
disabled by setting `ObjectListView.TriggerCellOverEventsWhenOverHeader` to `false`.

.. _recipe-auto-updates:

51. Can I get rid of the `RefreshObject()` calls?
-------------------------------------------------

    *Whenever my model object changes, I have to call RefreshObject().
    Can't you do something so that I don't have to remember to do that?*

Of course I can -- but I'll still needs your help. `ObjectListView` will happily
update itself when your model object is updated -- but it has to know
when your model is updated. In the WPF world, the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface is used for exactly this purpose, so `ObjectListView` uses that too.

[If you aren't familiar with the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface, do a quick Google search
and read up on what it's for and how it works. Then come back and continue with this recipe. 
It's OK... I'll wait]

To use this "auto updating" mechanism, you must:

* implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` on your model class
* set `ObjectListView.UseNotifyPropertyChanged` to `true`
* call `ObjectListView.SetObjects()`

Now you will only have to modify a property in your model class, and `ObjectListView` will automatically
reflect that change. 

`ObjectListView` will continue to listen for changes to your model objects until they are removed
from the list, either by changing its contents via `Objects` or `SetObjects()`, or by explicitly
removing a model using `RemoveObject()`. 

Objects that are added through `AddObject()` or `InsertObject()`
will be subscribed to for future notifications.

Caveats
^^^^^^^

If you set `UseNotifyPropertyChanged` on a virtual lists (e.g. `FastObjectListView`), the 
subscription mechanism will dutifully subscribe to all models in the control, even if there 
are 10,000,000 of them. This may take some time :)

Don't use this mechanism on data-bound versions of `ObjectListView`. They have their own way
of staying in sync with changes.

The notification mechanism is a convenience device, not a performance optimization. It is not
particularly smart. If you change eight properties, `ObjectListView` will refresh the 
corresponding item eight times.


.. _recipe-buttons:

52. How can I put a button into a cell?
---------------------------------------

To make a button appear in a cell, set `OLVColumn.IsButton` to `true`. The column will then draw its aspect
as a system-themed button (complete with hot highlighting).

.. image:: images/button-states.png

When the user clicks on a button, the `ObjectListView` will trigger a `ButtonClicked` event::

    this.olv.ButtonClick += delegate(object sender, CellClickEventArgs e) {
        Debug.WriteLine(String.Format("Button clicked: ({0}, {1}, {2})", e.RowIndex, e.SubItem, e.Model));

        // Take some action on e.Model based on which button (e.ColumnIndex) was clicked

        // ...

        // If something about the object changed, you probably want to refresh the model
        this.olv.RefreshObject(e.Model);
    };

Button sizing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buttons can either be fixed size, cell sized or resized to match their text. This is control by
the `ButtonSizing` property:

* `ButtonSizingMode.FixedBounds` -- Each button will be the same size, as set by `ButtonSize` property.

* `ButtonSizingMode.CellBounds` -- Each button will be the size of the cell, inset by `CellPadding`

* `ButtonSizingMode.TextBounds` -- Each button will be resized to hold the contents, expanded by `ButtonPadding`. The size is limited by `ButtonMinWidth` and `ButtonMaxWidth`.

Other bits
^^^^^^^^^^

If the aspect for a cell is null or empty, no button will be drawn. 
Use this to produce rows without buttons.

Buttons are normally disabled when the row is disabled. If you want the button to still be clickable,
even when the row is disabled, set `EnableButtonWhenItemIsDisabled` to `true`.

Buttons are drawn using instances of `ColumnButtonRenderer`. You can create your own subclass of this and
install it as the `Renderer` for the column to draw buttons as you want. You have to install your renderer
*before* setting `IsButton` to `true`, otherwise your renderer may not be correctly configured.


.. _recipe-cpu-onmousemove:

53. How can I reduce the CPU usage on mouse move?
-------------------------------------------------

   *When I move the mouse back and forth quickly over the control, the CPU usage
   jumps to about 8%! What's that all about and how can I stop it?*

This CPU usge is caused by "hot" items -- things that look different when the mouse is over them. 
Things like hot rows, or hyperlinks, or inline checkboxes and buttons.
For ObjectListView to handle "hot" items, whenever the mouse moves to a new point, the
control has to:

1. figure out what the mouse is over now
2. if the mouse is over something different (or nothing at all), it has to remove the previous hot effect (if any)
3. if the mouse is over something hot, it has to redraw that thing in a hot state.

Each of these are somewhat expensive operations, but it doesn't normally matter since mouse move
events are low priority events -- almost idle events.

But if you want to remove this CPU usage, you just have to turn off all "hot" formatting.

* UseHotItem
* UseHyperlinks
* UseHotControls

With all these set to *false*, the control will no longer draw anything different when the mouse
moves over it, but you will save all those CPU cycles.

54. How can I put a description under something that looks like a title?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to make something that looks pretty like this, ObjectListView can help:

.. image:: images/described-task-row.png

The format shown in the "Task" column is done via a renderer called a `DecribedTaskRenderer` 
(not a very elegant name, I admit).

It consists of three parts: the normal `Aspect`, the normal `Image` and a description. The first two
are setup in the normal way, but the third is done via a property on the renderer `DescriptionAspectName`.

In Use
------

You will normally have to give the ObjectListView a specific `RowHeight` that allows for both 
the title and description. This is not auto calculated for you.

The images for the renderer will normally come from specific `ImageList` that contains larger than
normal icons. You can give this specific `ImageList` to the renderer by setting the `ImageList` property.
[All renderers can do this, but with a `DescribedTaskRenderer` you will almost always want to have
larger icons and will need to set the image list explicitly.] 

You can control the color and font of the title (`TitleColor` and `TitleFont`) and description -- guess :).

You can also change the space between the image and the text (`ImageTextSpace`), and between the title and 
the description (`TitleDescriptionSpace`)

When using a text filter on the `ObjectListView`, both the title and the description will be searched.
