:Subtitle: How I learned to stop worrying and love .NET ListView

==============
ObjectListView
==============

.. rubric:: ObjectListView is a C# wrapper around a .NET ListView. It makes the ListView
            much easier to use and provides some neat extra functionality.

Larry Wall, the author of Perl, once wrote that the three essential character flaws of any
good programmer were sloth, impatience and hubris. Good programmers want to do the minimum
amount of work (sloth). They want their programs to run quickly (impatience). They take
inordinate pride in what they have written (hubris).

ObjectListView encourages the vices of sloth and hubris, by allowing programmers to do far
less work but still produce great looking results.

I'm too impatient! Just show me what it can do!
-----------------------------------------------

Here is an example of what your ListView can look like with a few callbacks in place:

.. image:: images/fancy-screenshot.png

The TreeListView similarly make a tree structure look beautiful:

.. image:: images/treelistview.png

And this is the report that can be effortlessly produced from the ObjectListView:

.. image:: images/printpreview.png

Without wasting my time, just tell me what it does!
---------------------------------------------------

OK, here's the bullet point feature list:

* Automatically transforms a list of model objects into a fully functional ListView, including automatically sorting and grouping rows.
* Supports :ref:`owner drawing <owner-draw-label>`, including rendering animated graphics and images stored in a database.
* Easily :ref:`edit the cell values <cell-editing-label>`.
* Easily enable :ref:`drag and drop <dragdrop-label>`.
* Supports all ListView views (report, list, large and small icons).
* Supports automatic grouping.
* Supports collapsible groups (Vista only).
* Columns can be fixed-width, have a minimum and/or maximum width, or be space-filling (:ref:`Column Widths <recipe-column-width>`)
* Displays a :ref:`"list is empty" message <recipe-emptymsg>` when the list is empty (obviously).
* Supports :ref:`tooltips <recipe-tooltips>` for cells and for headers
* Supports :ref:`checkboxes in any column <recipe-checkbox>` as well as tri-state checkboxes
* Supports alternate rows background colors.
* Supports :ref:`custom formatting of rows <recipe-formatter>`.
* Supports :ref:`searching (by typing) on any column <recipe-search>`
* Supports :ref:`image and text overlays <recipe-overlays>`
* The `DataListView` version supports data binding.
* The `FastObjectListView` version can build a list of 10,000 objects in less than 0.1 seconds.
* The `VirtualObjectListView` version supports millions of rows through ListView's virtual mode.
* The `TreeListView` version combines an expandable tree structure with the columns of a ListView.

Seriously, after using an `ObjectListView`, you will never go back to using a plain `ListView`.

OK, I'm interested. What do I do next?
--------------------------------------

The source code to `ObjectListView` can be `downloaded here <download.html>`_. You
can also download a demonstration, documentation and unit tests on the same page.

After that, you might want to look at the :ref:`Getting Started` and the
:ref:`Cookbook` sections. Please make sure you have read and understood these
sections before asking questions in the Forum_. There is also an article
describing the `ObjectListView at CodeProject`_.

At some point, you will want to do something with an ObjectListView and it won't
be immediately obvious how to make it happen. After dutifully scouring the
:ref:`Getting Started` and the :ref:`Cookbook` sections, you decide that is is
still not obvious. The Forum_ section is the place to find all your as-yet-
unasked questions.

It may even be possible that you might find some undocumented features in the
code (also known as bugs). These "features" can be `reported here`_ and can be
tracked on the project's `Issue Tracker`_.

Finally, after you realise just how great the ObjectListView is, and how you
really have come to love .NET's ListView, you will be moved with gratitude to
`give a donation`_ to ensure the continued development of this code.

Technical details
-----------------

I've started keeping a :ref:`technical blog <blog>` documenting some of the efforts that were required to
solve some of the problem encountered within the ObjectListView.

* :ref:`This long article <blog-overlays>` talks about the problems and solutions encountered when developing the
  overlay feature of v2.2.

* :ref:`This article <blog-tooltip>` talks about the problems of trying to use a standard `ToolTip` class on a
  `ListView`.

What people have said about ObjectListView
------------------------------------------

When thinking about using some new code, it's always interesting to hear what others have said about it.

.. pull-quote:: I have been watching this control since 2007 and just checked the new features you've added recently and in the last couple of months. This has gotta be the best list control out there. You've done a brilliant job with this and I'm sure many others appreciate your work. Well done and keep it up!

   -- `Hakan <http://www.codeproject.com/Messages/3034884/feedback-about-this-control.aspx>`_

.. pull-quote:: I second that. This should be brought into the next version of the framework, it's brillant work!

   -- `id2008 <http://www.codeproject.com/Messages/3034969/Re-feedback-about-this-control.aspx>`_

I have a file verification program, and I just replaced the listview with yours, and 150 lines of code was made obsolete, and very few lines were added, it also improved performance massively. The light shine upon you, MS should send you some sort of gift for removing the largest headache .NET ever contrived.
