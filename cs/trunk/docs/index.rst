:Subtitle: .NET ListView on caffeine, guarana and steroids. 

==============
ObjectListView
==============

.. rubric:: ObjectListView is a C# wrapper around a .NET ListView. It makes the ListView
            much easier to use and teaches it some neat new tricks.

Larry Wall, the author of Perl, once wrote that the three essential character flaws of any
good programmer were sloth, impatience and hubris. Good programmers want to do the minimum
amount of work (sloth). They want their programs to run quickly (impatience). They take
inordinate pride in what they have written (hubris).

ObjectListView encourages the vices of sloth and hubris, by allowing programmers to do far
less work but still produce great looking results.

I'm too impatient! Just show me what it can do!
-----------------------------------------------

Here is an example of what your ListView can look like with a few callbacks in place:

.. image:: images/fancy-screenshot2.png

Put pretty graphics, buttons and descriptions on your list, to make your users love your application:

.. image:: images/described-task1.png

The `TreeListView` similarly make a tree structure look beautiful:

.. image:: images/treelistview.png

Need to print a report? `ListViewPrinter` effortlessly produces reports from an `ObjectListView`:

.. image:: images/printpreview.png

With a little work, you can even pretend to live in the halls of cool with something like this:

.. image:: images/foobar-lookalike.png


Without wasting my time, just tell me what it does!
---------------------------------------------------

OK, here's the bullet point feature list:

* Automatically transforms a list of model objects into a fully functional ListView, including automatically sorting and grouping rows.

* Easily :ref:`edit cell values <cell-editing-label>`.
* Easily :ref:`use drag and drop <dragdrop-label>`.
* Supports all ListView views (report, list, large and small icons).
* Supports :ref:`owner drawing <owner-draw-label>`, including rendering animated graphics and images stored in a database.
* Supports automatic grouping.
* Supports sophisticated :ref:`group formatting <recipe-groupformatting>`, including collapsible groups (Vista and later only).
* Columns can be fixed-width, have a minimum and/or maximum width, or be space-filling (:ref:`Column Widths <recipe-column-width>`)
* Displays a :ref:`"list is empty" message <recipe-emptymsg>` when the list is empty (obviously).
* Supports fancy :ref:`tooltips <recipe-tooltips>` for cells and for headers.
* Supports :ref:`buttons in cells <recipe-buttons>`.
* Supports :ref:`checkboxes in any column <recipe-checkbox>` as well as tri-state checkboxes.
* Supports :ref:`hierarchical checkboxes <recipe-hierarchical-checkboxes>` in `TreeListView`.
* Supports alternate rows background colors.
* Supports :ref:`custom formatting of rows <recipe-formatter>`.
* Supports :ref:`searching (by typing) on any column <recipe-search>`.
* Supports :ref:`image and text overlays <recipe-overlays>` as well as arbitrary :ref:`decorations <recipe-decorations>`.
* Supports :ref:`hyperlinks <recipe-hyperlink>`.
* Supports :ref:`hot tracking <recipe-hottracking>` with text font/color changes and with decorations.
* Supports :ref:`column header formatting <recipe-headerformatting>` including :ref:`checkboxes <recipe-checkbox-in-header>`, word wrapping and :ref:`vertical text <recipe-column-header-vertical>`.
* Supports :ref:`groups on virtual lists <recipe-virtualgroups>` (Vista and later only).
* Supports :ref:`transluscent hot item and selection <recipe-vistascheme>` like Vista even on XP.
* Supports :ref:`filtering <recipe-filtering>`, including the very common :ref:`iTunes-like text filtering <recipe-text-filtering>`.
* Supports :ref:`animations <animations-label>` on cells, row, and the entire list.
* Supports :ref:`column selection <recipe-column-selection>` through right-click on header.
* Supports :ref:`Excel-like column filtering <column-filtering-label>`.
* Supports :ref:`native background images <recipe-native-backgrounds>` with all their inherent limitations.
* Supports :ref:`disabled rows<recipe-disabled-rows>`
* Supports :ref:`automatic updates <recipe-auto-updates>` via standard `INotifyPropertyChanged`.

There are several flavours of `ObjectListView`:

* `FastObjectListView` can build a list of 10,000 objects in less than 0.1 seconds.
* `TreeListView` control combines :ref:`an expandable tree structure with the columns of a ListView <recipe-treelistview>`.
* There are :ref:`data binding versions of each flavour <recipe-databinding>`.

Seriously, after using an `ObjectListView`, you will never go back to using a plain `ListView`.

OK, I'm interested. What do I do next?
--------------------------------------

The source code to `ObjectListView` can be `downloaded here <download.html>`_. You
can also download a demonstration, documentation and unit tests on the same page.

After that, you might want to look at the :ref:`Getting Started <gettingstarted>` and the
:ref:`Cookbook` sections. Please make sure you have read and understood these
sections before asking questions in the Forum_. There is also an article
describing the `ObjectListView at CodeProject`_.

At some point, you will want to do something with an ObjectListView and it won't
be immediately obvious how to make it happen. After dutifully scouring the
:ref:`Getting Started <gettingstarted>` and the :ref:`Cookbook` sections, you decide that it is
still not obvious. The Forum_ section is the place to find all your as-yet-
unasked questions.

It may even be possible that you might find some undocumented features in the
code (also known as bugs). These "features" can be `reported here`_ and can be
tracked on the project's `Issue Tracker`_.

Technical details
-----------------

I've kept a :ref:`technical blog <blog>` documenting some of the efforts that were required to
solve some of the problem encountered within the ObjectListView.

* :ref:`Enabling disabling (20 May 2014)<blog-disabledrows>`

* :ref:`Creating hierarchical checkboxes (26 February 2014)<blog-hierarchicalcheckboxes>`

* :ref:`Flickering on virtual lists and the .NET bug that causes it<blog-virtuallistflickers>`

* :ref:`Lifting up the downtrodden ListViewGroup<blog-listviewgroups>`

* How can I make a :ref:`rearrangeable TreeListView <blog-rearrangingtreelistview>`?

* Surely :ref:`a little bug <blog-subitemboundsbug>` can't cause too much trouble?

* :ref:`This long article <blog-overlays>` talks about the problems and solutions encountered when developing the
  overlay feature of v2.2.

* :ref:`This article <blog-tooltip>` talks about the problems of trying to use a standard `ToolTip` class on a
  `ListView`.

Future directions
-----------------

v3.0 will be a big change. Until now, each version has strove to maintain strict backwards compatibility. v3.0 will not have this as a strict goal. It will be backwards compatible where possible, but will drop properties, events and methods where they do not fit within the new scheme. In particular, features that were a moment of design weakness (I'm looking at you *AlwaysGroupByColumn* and your friends) will disappear.

* Support for .NET 2.0 will be dropped. .NET 4.0 will become the minimum.

* Use `IEnumerable` whenever possible. `SelectedObjects`, `CheckedObjects`, `AddObjects()`, `InsertObjects()`
  `RefreshObjects()`, `RemoveObjects()`, and `CopyObjectsToClipboard()` will all be changed to use
  `IEnumerable`. This is with a view to using LINQ in future versions.

* All styling (cell, header, tool tips) will be unified, and will include custom renderers and hit detection.

* General cleanup/refactor

There is no definite timetable for this version.
