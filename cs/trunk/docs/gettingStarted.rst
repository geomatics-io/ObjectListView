Getting Started
===============

Introduction
------------

I often find that I have a collection of objects which I want to present to the
user in some sort of tabular format. It could be the list of clients for a
business, a list of known FTP servers or even something as mundane as a list of
files in a directory. User interface-wise, the `ListView` is the perfect control
for these situations. However, I find myself groaning at the thought of using
the `ListView` and secretly hoping that I can use a `ListBox` instead.

The reason for wanting to avoid the `ListView` is all the boilerplate code it
needs to work: make the `ListViewItems`, add all the `SubItems`, catch the header
click events and sort the items depending on the data type. When the user right
clicks on the list, I have to figure out which rows are selected, and then maps
those rows back into the model objects I am interested in. None of these tasks
are obvious if you don't already know the tricks, and even when you do, it is
annoying to have to code them again for each `ListView`. If you want to support
grouping, there's an even bigger chunk of boilerplate code to copy and then
modify slightly.

The `ObjectListView` was designed to take away all these repetitive tasks and so
make a `ListView` much easier -- even fun -- to use.

First Steps
-----------

There are two ways to use an `ObjectListView` in your project:

1. **Use the ObjectListView project**

* Download the `ObjectListView project <https://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/>`_

* Add the ObjectListView project to your project (right click on your
  solution; choose "Add...", "Existing Project", then choose the
  *ObjectListView.csproj*)

* In your project, add a reference to the ObjectListView project (right click
  on your project; choose "Add Reference...", choose "Projects" tab; then double
  click on the ObjectListView project)

* Build your project

* Once your project has been built, there should now be a new section in your
  Toolbox, "ObjectListView Components". In that section should be `ObjectListView`
  and its friends. (If you are using SharpDevelop, the section is called "Custom
  Components" and it appears at the bottom of the toolbox.) You can then drag an
  `ObjectListView` onto your window, and use it as you would a standard `ListView`
  control.

2. **Use ObjectListView.dll**

* If you don't want to add the ObjectListView project to your project, you can also just add the *ObjectListView.dll* file.

* Download or build the *ObjectListView.dll* file.

* In your project, add a reference to the *ObjectListView.dll* (right click on
  your project; choose "Add Reference...", choose "Browse" tab; navigate to the
  ObjectListView.dll file and double click on it).

* Adding the dll does not automatically add any new components into your
  toolbox. You will need to add them manually after you have added the dll to your
  project.

Seeing the big picture
----------------------

If you are a visual person, the process I'm about to explain is this:

.. image:: images/ModelToScreenProcess.png

You give the `ObjectListView` a list of model objects. It extracts aspects from those
objects, converts those aspects to strings, and then builds the control with those
strings.

Keep this image in mind when reading the following text.

Mental gear shift
-----------------

Before you start trying to use an `ObjectListView`, you should understand that the
process of using one is different to the process of using a normal `ListView`. A
normal `ListView` is essentially passive: it sits there, and you poke and prod it
and eventually it looks like you want. An `ObjectListView` is much more active.
You tell it what you want done and the `ObjectListView` does it for you.

An `ObjectListView` is used declaratively: you state what you want the
`ObjectListView` to do (via its configuration), then you give it your collection
of model objects, and the `ObjectListView` does the work of building the `ListView`
for you.

This is a different approach to using a `ListView`. You must get your mind around
this, especially if you have done any `ListView` programming before (See :ref:`unlearn`).

The crucial part of using an `ObjectListView` is configuring it. Most of this
configuration can be done within the IDE by setting properties on the
`ObjectListView` itself or on the columns that are used within the list. Some
configuration cannot be done through properties: these more complex
configurations are done by installing delegates (more on this later).

Once the columns and control are configured, putting it into action is simple.
You give it the list of model objects you want it to display, and the
`ObjectListView` will build the `ListView` for you::

	this.myFirstOlv.SetObjects(myListOfSongs);

Model vs View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's this "model" you keep talking about?

Your model objects are the data used by your application. They are the part that
stays the same when you decide make your desktop application available as a web
app, or vice versa. The view is the part that presents your model objects to the
user. The view changes completely when you move your application to the web.

For more detailed discussion, see `here <http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/stringtemplate.html>`_
or any other of the thousand sites that discuss this.

.. _unlearn:

Unlearn you must
----------------

.. admonition:: This section is for those who are familiar with using a `ListView`.
    :class: singleLineCallout

	ignored

This section is for those who are familiar with using a `ListView`, either from
.NET or (shudder) from Petzold-style windows. Complete novices can skip this
section.

For those of you who have struggled with a `ListView` before, you must unlearn. An
`ObjectListView` is not a drop in replacement for a `ListView`. If you have an
existing project, you cannot simply create an `ObjectListView` instead of creating
a `ListView`. An `ObjectListView` needs a different mindset. If you can perform the
mind-mangling step of changing your thinking, `ObjectListView` will be your best
friend.

.. _listviewitems-are-evil:

Beware of `ListViewItems`. You never need to add `ListViewItems` to an
`ObjectListView`. If you find yourself adding things to the `Items` collection,
creating `ListViewItems`, or adding sub-items to anything, then you need to stop --
you are being seduced to the dark side. An `ObjectListView` does all that work for
you. It owns the `ListViewItems` and will destroy and recreate them as needed.
Your job is to tell the `ObjectListView` what information you want the `ListViewItems`
to contain, and then to give it the list of objects to show.

Resist the temptation to add, edit, remove, or otherwise mess with `ListViewItems`
-- it will not work.

There is also no need to hide information in a `ListViewItem`. Old style `ListView`
programming often required attaching a key of some sort to each `ListViewItem`, so
that when the user did something with a row, the programmer would know which
model object that row was related to. This attaching was often done by creating
one or more zero-width columns, or by setting the `Tag` property on the
`ListViewItem`.

With an `ObjectListView`, you do not need to do this. The
`ObjectListView` already knows which model object is behind each row. In many
cases, the programmer simply uses the `SelectedObjects` property to find out which
model objects the user wants to do something to.


Close your eyes and imagine...
------------------------------

For the purposes of this introduction, we'll imagine that you are writing an
application to manage a music library. One of your central model object might be
`Song`, which could looks something like this::

	class Song {
	    public Song () {
	    }
	    public string Title {
	        get { ... };
	        set{ ... };
	    }
	    public DateTime LastPlayed {
	        get { ... };
	        set{ ... };
	    }
	    public float GetSizeInMb {
	        ...
	    }
	    public int Rating {
	        get { ... };
	        set{ ... };
	    }
		...
	}

You can download all the projects and source used in this getting started section here:
`getting-started.zip (250 KB) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview/examples/getting-started.zip/download>`_.


This bit goes here, that bit goes there
---------------------------------------

The first configuration step is to tell each column which bit (called an
"aspect") of your model object it is going to display. You do this through a
`Columns` properties. You can edit the `Columns` of an `ObjectListView` by either:

1. Finding the `Columns` property of the `ObjectListView` and clicking the ellipsis
   (...) button next to it;

2. Or by showing the quick commands for the `ObjectListView` (press on the small
   arrow at the top right of the control) and clicking "Edit Columns."

You should now see a dialog entitled "OLVColumn Collection Editor." Click "Add"
to add a new column to the `ObjectListView`. Once you have a column selected, all
its properties are presented on the right hand side (I find it helpful to resize
the dialog so I can see all the properties at once).

At the top of the list of properties is a property `AspectName`. This is the
property that tells the column which aspect of the model object it should
display. The `AspectName` will hold the name of the property, method or field that
will be shown in this column.

To show the Song's title in the first column, you set the first column's
`AspectName` to "Title".


Converting to strings
---------------------

OK, we've told our first column which bit of data it should display. For the
Title, this is all that is necessary. But for our second column which will show
LastPlayed, there is another configuration we should consider: converting our
bit of data to a string.

A `ListView` control can only display strings. Everything else - booleans,
integers, dates, whatever - has to be converted to a string before it can be
given to the `ListView`. By default, the `ObjectListView` converts data to strings
like this::

	stringForDisplay = String.Format("{0}", aspectValue);

You can use a different format string (instead of the default "{0}") by setting
the `AspectToStringFormat` property. If the `AspectToStringFormat` property isn't
empty, its value will be used as the format string instead of "{0}". See
`String.Format()` documentation to understand its abilities. Some useful format
strings are "{0:d}" to show a short date from a DateTime value, and "{0:C}" for
currency values.

So, we would configure our second column like this: AspectName: "LastPlayed",
AspectToStringFormat: "{0:d}".


Put it all together and what have you got?
------------------------------------------

Our third column is to display the GetSizeInMb aspect. We'd like this to put
commas into its string representation, so we would configure it like this:
AspectName: "GetSizeInMb", AspectToStringFormat: "{0:#,##0.0}".

Our fourth column is to display the Rating aspect. It does not need a special
AspectToStringFormat, so it would simply be configured with AspectName:
"Rating".

Having finished our IDE configuration, we set the whole thing into action with our one line of code::

	this.olvSongs.SetObjects(listOfSongs);

And we should get something like this:

.. image:: images/gettingstarted-example1.png


What have we achieved?
----------------------

Underwhelmed? Admittedly, it's not much to look at, but be patient. Also,
consider how much work you had to do to make it happen: some IDE configuration
and one line of code. It doesn't look so bad now, does it?

With those column definitions, we have a `ListView` that shows the title, date
last played, size (in megabytes) and rating of various tracks in your music
library. But, actually, we have quite a bit more than that. Without any extra
work, sorting, grouping, search by typing and column selection all work:

* Clicking on the column headers will sort and reverse sort the rows. The sort is
  accurate for the data type: when sorting by size, a song of 35 megabytes will
  come after a song of 9 megabytes.

* If you enable groups on the `ListView` (set `ShowGroups` to True), the `ListView` will
  group the rows according to the column clicked.

* If you type a couple of letters, the row that matches the typed letters will be selected.
  The rows are matched on the *sort* column values, not the first column values.

* If you right click on the column headers, a menu will popup which allows you to
  select which columns are visible.


Adding some images
------------------

OK, that's good, but any real `ListView` needs to be able to put little icons next
to the text. That is our next task.

Deciding which icon to put in a column cannot be done in the IDE. Very often the
icon used depends on the model object being displayed. To decide on an icon, we
need a more complex type of configuration: installing a delegate.

A delegate is basically a piece of code that you give to an `ObjectListView`
saying, "When you need to do this, call this piece of code" where this can be
any of several tasks. In this case, we install an ImageGetter delegate, which
tells the `ObjectListView`, "When you need to figure out the image for this model
object, call this piece of code."

*If the word "delegate" worries you, think of them as function pointers where the parameter and return types can be verified.
If that makes no sense to you, just keep reading. It will (possibly) become clear with some examples.*

First, you need a method that matches the `ImageGetterDelegate` signature: it must
accept a single `object` parameter and returns an `object`. A completely frivolous
example might be like this, which displays a star image if the song has a rating
80 or higher and a normal song icon otherwise::

	public object SongImageGetter(object rowObject) {
	    Song s = (Song)rowObject;
	    if (s.Rating >= 80)
	        return "star";
	    else
	        return "song";
	};

You install this delegate by assigning it to the `ImageGetter` property on the first column::

	this.titleColumn.ImageGetter = new ImageGetterDelegate(this.SongImageGetter);

Some things to notice:
----------------------

The delegate is passed a parameter of type `object`. The `ObjectListView` doesn't
know anything about your model objects, not even their class. It only ever deals
with them as `object`. In your delegates, casting `rowObject` to an instance of your
model will almost always be the first step (but see `TypedObjectListView` for an
alternative).

The value returned from the `ImageGetter` delegate is used as an index into the
`ObjectListView`'s `SmallImageList`. As such, the `ImageGetter` can return either a
`string` or an `int`. (If the `ObjectListView` is owner-drawn, the `ImageGetter` can
return an `Image`, but that's a story for another day).

The `ImageGetter` delegate is installed on the column, since each column can have
its own image.

.NET 2.0 added the convenience of anonymous delegates (to C# at least -- VB
users are stuck with using separate methods). In an anonymous delegates, the
code for the function is inlined, like this::

	this.titleColumn.ImageGetter = delegate (object rowObject) {
	    Song s = (Song)rowObject;
	    if (s.Rating >= 80)
	        return "star";
	    else
	        return "song";
	};

For small methods, anonymous delegate are much more convenient.


Smarter string conversions
--------------------------

Another useful delegate that you can install is the `AspectToStringConverter`
delegate. Sometimes, converting a bit of the model (the Aspect) to a string can
be more than `String.Format()` can handle. `AspectToStringConverter` takes over when
`String.Format()` is not enough.

In our `Song` class, the actual size of the song is stored as `long SizeInBytes`. It
would be nice if we could show the size as "360 bytes", "901 KB", or "1.1 GB"
which ever was more appropriate.

To do something smarter like this, we would change the `AspectName` of our third
column to be "SizeInBytes" and install a `AspectToStringConverter` delegate, like
this::

	this.sizeColumn.AspectToStringConverter = delegate(object x) {
	    long size = (long)x;
	    int[] limits = new int[] { 1024 * 1024 * 1024, 1024 * 1024, 1024 };
	    string[] units = new string[] { "GB", "MB", "KB" };

	    for (int i = 0; i < limits.Length; i++) {
	        if (size >= limits[i])
	            return String.Format("{0:#,##0.##} " + units[i], ((double)size / limits[i]));
	    }

	    return String.Format("{0} bytes", size); ;
	};

Just a couple more things to configure. You need to make an `ImageList`, give it
the images you want, and then assign it to the `SmallImageList` property of the
`ObjectListView`. And finally, we will set the `UseAlternatingBackColors` property
to *true*.

Putting all these bits together, we now have something that looks like this:

.. image:: images/gettingstarted-example2.png

Hey! That's starting to not look too bad.

.. _grouping-label:

Grouping
--------

The last part of our getting started project will be to improve how the `ObjectListView` displays groups.

If you turn on the ShowGroups property on the `ObjectListView`, you will see that
it automatically supports grouping. Normally, the first column groups rows that
have the same initial letter. You can give other columns this same behaviour by
setting the `UseInitialLetterForGroup` property to *true*.

.. image:: images/gettingstarted-example3.png

Quite a lot happens under the hood when grouping is enabled. When the `ObjectListView` is rebuilt:
	1. A group "key" is calculated for each model object.
	2. All model objects that return the same "key" are placed in the same group.
	3. That group "key" is then converted to a string. This string becomes the label for the group.
	4. Each group of model objects is then sorted
	5. The sorted objects added beneath their group's label.

The crucial part to understand is that all model objects that have the same
"key" are placed in the same group. By default, the "key" is the aspect of the
model object as calculated by the grouping column. So when grouping is enabled
and the user clicks the "Size" column, the `Songs` are grouped by their
`SizeInBytes` value, that is, all `Songs` that have exactly the same number of bytes
are placed in the same group.

The default way of calculating the group key works, but it can be improved. You
can do your own calculation by (you guessed it) installing a delegate, the
`GroupKeyGetter` delegate.


Improving the "Last Played" grouping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to improve the way the "Last Played" column is grouped. The default
group key for this column is the value of the `LastPlayed` property for each `Song`.
This is not very useful - every song ends up in its own group. (If you can
explain why, well done! You're right on the ball). Worse, when the key is
converted to a label, only the date part is displayed, so it looks as if your
control is broken.

.. image:: images/gettingstarted-example4.png

We'll change the "Last Played" column so that it groups songs by the month they
were last played -- all the songs last played in July should be in the same
group. To do this, we install a `GroupKeyGetter` on the lastPlayedColumn::

	this.lastPlayedColumn.GroupKeyGetter = delegate(object rowObject) {
	    Song song = (Song)rowObject;
	    return new DateTime(song.LastPlayed.Year, song.LastPlayed.Month, 1);
	};

This will group the songs by just their year and month. We also install another
delegate that will convert our group key into a string that will be used as the
label for the group::

	this.lastPlayedColumn.GroupKeyToTitleConverter = delegate(object groupKey) {
	    return ((DateTime)groupKey).ToString("MMMM yyyy");
	};

With these two simple delegates in place, now grouping by the "Last Played" column looks much better.

.. image:: images/gettingstarted-example5.png

Why a two-step tango?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why does `ObjectListView` have these two steps: key getting and key to title?
Isn't it simpler to just group model objects by their group label?

Because we want to be able to sort the groups themselves correctly. To do this
we need to have the actual group key, not just the group label. For example,
with our LastPlayed column, the group "January 2008" should appear before the
group "February 2008." But that's not possible if we only have the group labels.
So we need the two-step tango.


Grouping by Ratings
-------------------

The "Last Played" column now groups nicely. Let's see what we can do with the
"Rating" column. The Rating is a number between 0 and 100 where 0 means "Should
be deleted" and 100 means "Should be played continuously through all available
loudspeakers".

For our example, we'll group them like this:

========  ================================================
 <=20	  "Why do you even have these songs?"
 21-39	  "Passable I suppose"
 40-79	  "Buy more like these"
 80-100	  "To be played continuously"
========  ================================================

We could do this by installing a `GroupKeyGetter` and a `GroupKeyToTitleConverter`,
but this is such a common use case, there's a special function to do it for you:
`MakeGroupies()`. We'll use this method like this::

	this.ratingColumn.MakeGroupies(
	    new int[] { 20, 39, 79 },
	    new string[] { "Why do you even have these songs?", "Passable I suppose",
		               "Buy more like these", "To be played continuously" }
	);

The first array contains the cutoff points. Every group key less than or equal
to the first cutoff point goes into one group. Keys greater than the first
cutoff but less than or equal to the second cutoff go into another group, and so
on. A group key greater than the last cutoff goes into yet another group.

The second array contains the group labels for the matching cutoff point. This
array must have one more item than the cutoff point array. This last item is the
label for the group whose keys were greater than the last cutoff value.

So with our `Songs`, songs that have a `Rating` of less than or equal to 20 go into
a group labelled "Why do you even have these songs?". Songs with a `Rating`
between 21 and 39 go into a second group labelled "Passable I suppose". Songs
with a `Rating` 80 and above fall into the last group labelled "To be played
continuously".

It's a bit complicated to explain, but it's quite easy to use.

With the `MakeGroupies()` in place, grouping by our Rating column, now looks like this:

.. image:: images/gettingstarted-example6.png

And they're off and running
---------------------------

Well done! You've made it to the end of the tutorial. You should by now have a
reasonable grasp of some of the things an `ObjectListView` can do, and how to use
it in your application.

If you need further help, you can look at the :ref:`Cookbook <cookbook-label>`
and the `Forum <https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=812922>`_ for
those questions that just don't have answer anywhere else.

Don't forget: Use The Source Luke! You have all the source code. If you can't
figure something out, read the code and see what is actually happening.
