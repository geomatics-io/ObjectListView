ObjectListView and Drag & Drop
==============================

As of v2.2, `ObjectListView` has sophisticated support for dragging and dropping.
This support makes it easy to support interapplication drag and drop, dragging
within your application, and making lists that can be rearranged by dragging.

The easy way
------------

The simpliest way to use drag and drop in an `ObjectListView` is
through the `IsSimpleDragSource` and `IsSimpleDropSink` properties (which
can be set through the IDE).

Setting these gives an `ObjectListView` that will allow objects to be dragged
and dropped on items, like this:

.. image:: images/dragdrop-example1.png

If you set `IsSimpleDragSource` to *true*, the `ObjectListView` will
be able to initiate drags. It will drag the currently selected items,
as well as creating text and HTML versions of those rows that can
be dropped onto other programs.

If you set `IsSimpleDropSink` to *true*, the `ObjectListView` will be able to
receive drops. The normal drop sink does a lot of work for you: figuring out
which item is under the mouse, handling auto scrolling, drawing user feedback.
However, there are two things that it can't figure out for itself:

1. Are the dragged objects allowed to be dropped at the current point?
2. What should happen when the drop occurs?

So, the normal drop sink triggers two events: `CanDrop` and `Dropped`. To
actually be useful, you need to handle these events. You can set
up handlers for these events within the IDE, like normal.

You can alternatively listen for the `ModelCanDrop` and `ModelDropped` events.
This second pair of events are triggered when the source of the drag is another
`ObjectListView`. These events work the same as the `CanDrop` and `Dropped`
events except that the argument block includes useful information:

* The `ObjectListView` initiated the drag
* The model objects are being dragged
* The model object is current target of the drop


Handling the events - CanDrop
-----------------------------

In the `CanDrop` (or `ModelCanDrop`) event, the handler has to decide if the currently dragged
items can be dropped at the current location. To indicate what operation
is allowed, the handler must set the `Effect` property::

    private void listViewSimple_ModelCanDrop(object sender, ModelDropEventArgs e) {
        Person person = e.TargetModel as Person;
        if (person == null) {
            e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None;
        } else {
            if (person.MaritalStatus == MaritalStatus.Married) {
                e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None;
                e.InfoMessage = "Can't drop on someone who is already married";
            } else {
                e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Move;
            }
        }
    }

Inside the `CanDrop` handler, you can set the `InfoMessage` property to a
string. If you do this, the string will be shown to the user while they are
dragging. This can be used to tell the user why something cannot be dropped at
that particular point, or to explain what will happen if the drop occured there:

.. image:: images/dragdrop-infomsg.png

This message is displayed by a specialised `TextOverlay`, which is exposed through
the `Billboard` property of the `SimpleDropSink` class. You can make changes to the
messages appearance through this property.

Handling the events - Dropped
-----------------------------

If the allowed effect was anything other than `None`, then when the items are
dropped, a `Dropped` (or a `ModelDropped`) event will be triggered. This is
where the actual work of processing the dropped item should occur. A silly
example from the demo looks like this::

    private void listViewSimple_ModelDropped(object sender, ModelDropEventArgs e) {
        // If they didn't drop on anything, then don't do anything
        if (e.TargetModel == null)
            return;

        // Change the dropped people plus the target person to be married
        ((Person)e.TargetModel).MaritalStatus = MaritalStatus.Married;
        foreach (Person p in e.SourceModels)
            p.MaritalStatus = MaritalStatus.Married;

        // Force them to refresh
        e.RefreshObjects();
    }

The `ModelDropped` event has a convenience method, `RefreshObjects()`, which refreshes all the objects
involved in the operation. This is particularly useful with operations on `TreeListViews`.

Simply doing more
-----------------

If you want to do more than this, you have to start playing with the objects
that actually implement the drag and drop: `SimpleDataSource` and `SimpleDropSink`
(though calling the latter "simple" is a bit of a misnomer).


SimpleDataSource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The major task of the `SimpleDataSource` is to setup a `DataObject` which can be used
for dragging and dropping. If you want your `ObjectListView` to support other data
formats, you will need subclass `SimpleDataSource` and add the data formats you want.

SimpleDropSink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`SimpleDropSink` is a lot more interesting and a lot more configurable.

Doing a lot more - Drag and Drop the hard way
---------------------------------------------

It's not really that hard -- just more work than the easy way.

If you want to have complete control of the dragging process, you
can implement the `IDragSource` interface, and then give that
implementation to the `ObjectListView` by setting the `DragSource`
property.

Similarly, if you want to have complete control of the dropping process, you
can implement the `IDropSink` interface, and then give that
implementation to the ObjectListView by setting the `DropSink`
property.

For maximum flexibility, the `IDropSink` basically just unifies the
full suite of Windows drag-drop messages::

    public interface IDropSink
    {
        ObjectListView ListView { get; set; }

        void DrawFeedback(Graphics g, Rectangle bounds);
        void Drop(DragEventArgs args);
        void Enter(DragEventArgs args);
        void GiveFeedback(GiveFeedbackEventArgs args);
        void Leave();
        void Over(DragEventArgs args);
        void QueryContinue(QueryContinueDragEventArgs args);
    }

The only new method in this list is the `DrawFeedback()` method. This
is where the `DropSink` can draw feedback onto the `ObjectListView`
to indicate the state of the drop. This drawing is done over the
top of the `ObjectListView` and this will normally involve some form
of alpha blending.

In almost all cases, you can subclass `AbstractDropSink` which provides
minimal implementations of all these methods.

.. _dragdrop-rearranging:

Rearranging rows by dragging
----------------------------

One common use for drag and drop is to provide a rearrangeable `ObjectListView`.
This is so common that there is a prebuild component to do this for you.
This is done by installing a `RearrangingDropSink`::

    this.objectListView1.DragSource = new SimpleDragSource();
    this.objectListView1.DropSink = new RearrangingDropSink(false);

This turns `objectListView1` into a rearrangeble list, where the user can
rearrange the rows by dragging them. The *false* parameter says that this
sink will not accept drags from other `ObjectListViews`.

The class is clever but it is not magical. It works even when the `ObjectListView`
is sorted or grouped, but it is up to the programmer
to decide what rearranging such lists "means".

Example: if the control is grouping
students by academic grade, and the user drags a "Fail" grade student into the "A+"
group, it is the responsibility of the programmer to makes the appropriate changes
to the model and redraw/rebuild the control so that the users action makes sense.

Similarly, it is up to the programmer to decide what should happen if the user
rearranges rows when the list is sorted.

It also cannot work on `DataListView`, `VirtualObjectListView` and `TreeListViews`
since the data in those control is outside the control of the `ObjectListView`.
For those controls, you will have to use (or subclass) a `SimpleDropSink` and do
the actual rearranging and refreshing yourself.

See :ref:`this blog <blog-rearrangingtreelistview>` for a detailed discussion of
how to make a rearrangeable `TreeListView`.
