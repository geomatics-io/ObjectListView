OK. Now that you're interested, how do you actually get the code?

Not-so-stable releases
----------------------

`ObjectListView 2.5 beta`_ is now available (April 2010). This will have bugs. Please log them
on the tracker against the 2.5beta version and I will fix them before the final 2.5 release.

Bleeding-edge source
--------------------

If you are a very keen developer, you can access the SVN repository directly for this
project. The following SVN command will fetch the most recent version from the repository::

 svn co https://objectlistview.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/objectlistview/cs/trunk objectlistview

There are details on `how to use Subversion here <http://p.sf.net/sourceforge/svn>`_ on SourceForge.

Please remember that code within the SVN is bleeding edge. It has not been well-tested and
is almost certainly full of bugs. If you just want to play with the ObjectListView, it's
better to stay with the official releases, where the bugs are (hopefully) less obvious.
