Not-so-stable releases
----------------------

v2.3 beta was made available on 22 September 2009. This is an interface stable release, meaning that only bugs
will be fixed before version is offically released.

There is a **lot** of new functionality in the v2.3 release.
See `"What's new in 2.3"`__ for a description of what's new.

This release can be download from here: `ObjectListView v2.3b`__

.. __: https://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview/v2.3beta/ObjectListViewFull-2.3b.zip/download

It also has its own branch in the repository, which will be updated as bugs are found and fixed::

 svn co https://objectlistview.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/objectlistview/cs/branches/v2.3 objectlistview-v2.3b

Bleeding-edge source
--------------------

If you are a very keen developer, you can access the SVN repository directly for this
project. The following SVN command will fetch the most recent version from the repository::

 svn co https://objectlistview.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/objectlistview/cs/trunk objectlistview

There are details on `how to use Subversion here <https://sourceforge.net/docs/E09>`_ on SourceForge.

Please remember that code within the SVN is bleeding edge. It has not been well-tested and
is almost certainly full of bugs. If you just want to play with the ObjectListView, it's
better to stay with the official releases, where the bugs are (hopefully) less obvious.
