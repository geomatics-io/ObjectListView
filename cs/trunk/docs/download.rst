Bleeding-edge source
--------------------

If you are a very keen developer, you can access the SVN repository directly for this
project. The following SVN command will fetch the most recent version from the repository::

 svn co https://objectlistview.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/objectlistview/cs/trunk objectlistview

There are details on `how to use Subversion here <https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/svn%20-%20Classic/>`_ on SourceForge.

Please remember that code within the SVN is bleeding edge. It has not been well-tested and
is almost certainly full of bugs. If you just want to play with the ObjectListView, it's
better to stay with the official releases, where the bugs are (hopefully) less obvious.
